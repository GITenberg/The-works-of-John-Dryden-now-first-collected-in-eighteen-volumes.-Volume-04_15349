<h3 class="chap">THE CONQUEST OF GRANADA.</h3>

<p>This play,&mdash;for the two parts only constitute an entire drama
betwixt them,&mdash;seems to have been a favourite with Dryden, as well
as with the public. In the Essay upon Heroic Plays, as well as in
the dedication, the character of Almanzor is dwelt upon with that
degree of complacency which an author experiences in analyzing
a successful effort of his genius. Unquestionably the gross improbability
of a hero, by his single arm, turning the tide of battle as
he lists, did not appear so shocking in the age of Dryden, as in
ours. There is no doubt, that, while personal strength and prowess
were of more consequence than military skill and conduct, the
feats of a single man were sometimes sufficient to determine the
fate of an engagement, more especially when exerted by a knight,
sheathed in complete mail, against the heartless and half-armed
mass, which constituted the feudal infantry. Those, who have
perused Barbour's History of Robert Bruce, Geoffrey de Vinsauf's
account of the wars of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion, or even the
battles detailed by Froissart and Joinville, are familiar with instances
of breaches defended, and battles decided, by the prowess
of a single arm. The leader of a feudal army was expected
by his followers not only to point out the path to victory but
to lead the way in person. It is true, that the military art had
been changed in this particular long before the days of Dryden.
Complete armour was generally laid aside; fire-arms had superseded
the use of the lance and battle-axe; and, above all, the universal
institution of standing armies had given discipline and military
skill their natural and decisive superiority over untaught
strength, and enthusiastic valour. But the memory of what had
been, was still familiar to the popular mind, and preserved not
only by numerous legends and traditions, but also by the cast of
the fashionable works of fiction. It is, indeed, curious to remark,
how many minute remnants of a system of ancient manners can be
traced long after it has become totally obsolete. Even down to
the eighteenth century, the portrait of every soldier of rank was
attired in complete armour, though, perhaps, he never saw a suit
of mail excepting in the Tower of London; and on the same principle
of prescriptive custom, Addison was the first poet who ventured
to celebrate a victorious general for skill and conduct, instead
of such feats as are appropriated to Guy of Warwick, or
<span class="pgnm" id="page_004"></span>
Bevis of Hampton. The fashion of attributing mighty effects
to individual valour being thus prevalent, even in circumstances
when every one knew the supposition to be entirely gratuitous,
the same principle, with much greater propriety, continued
to be applied in works of fiction, where the scene was usually carried
back to times in which the personal strength of a champion really
had some efficacy. It must be owned, however, that the authors of
the French romances carried the influence of individual strength and
courage beyond all bounds of modesty and reason. In the Grand
Cyrus, Artamenes, upon a moderate computation, exterminates
with his own hand, in the course of the work, at least a hundred
thousand fighting men. These monstrous fictions, however, constituted
the amusement of the young and the gay<a class="ftnt" href="#Alman_1-1">[1]</a>, in the age of
Charles II., and from one of these very books Dryden admits his having
drawn, at least in part, the character of his Moorish warrior.
The public was, therefore, every way familiarised with such chivalrous
exploits as those of Almanzor; and if they did not altogether
command the belief, at least they did not revolt the imagination, of
an audience: And this must certainly be admitted as a fair apology
for the extravagance of his heroic achievements.</p>

<p>But, it is not only the actual effects of Almanzor's valour, which
appear to us unnatural, but also the extraordinary principles and
motives by which those exertions are guided. Here also, we must
look back to the Gothic romances, and to those of Scudery
and Calprenede. In fact, the extravagance of sentiment is no
less necessary than the extravagance of achievement to constitute
a true knight errant; and such is Almanzor. Honour and
love were the sole deities worshipped by this extraordinary race,
who, though their memory and manners are preserved chiefly in
works of fiction, did once exist in real life, and actually conducted
armies, and governed kingdoms, upon principles as strained and hyperbolical
as those of the Moorish champion. If Almanzor, at the
command of his mistress, aids his hated rival to the destruction of
his own hopes, he only discharges the duty of a good knight, who
was bound to sacrifice himself, and all his hopes and wishes, at
the slightest command of her, to whom he had vowed his service,
and who, in the language of chivalry, was to him as the soul is to
the body. The reader may recollect the memorable invasion of
<span class="pgnm" id="page_005"></span>
England by James IV. of Scotland, in which he hazarded and actually
lost his own life, and the flower of his nobility, because the
queen of France, who called him her knight, had commanded him
to march three miles on English ground for her sake.</p>

<p>Less can be said to justify the extravagant language in which
Almanzor threatens his enemies, and vaunts his own importance.
This is not common in the heroes of romance, who are usually
as remarkable for their modesty of language as for their prowess;
and still more seldom does, in real life, a vain-glorious boaster vindicate
by his actions the threats of his tongue. It is true, that
men of a fervent and glowing character are apt to strain their
speech beyond the modesty of ordinary conversation, and display,
in their language, the fire which glows in their bosoms; but the
subject of their effusions is usually connected not with their own
personal qualities, or feats, but with some extraneous object of
their pursuit, or admiration. Thus, the burst of Hotspur concerning
the pursuit of honour paints his enthusiastic character; but
it would be hard to point out a passage indicating that exuberant
confidence in his own prowess, and contempt of every one else, so
liberally exhibited by Almanzor. Instances of this defect are but
too thickly sown through the piece; for example the following rant.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>If from thy hands alone my death can be,</p>
<p>I am immortal, and a God to thee.</p>
<p>If I would kill thee now, thy fate's so low,</p>
<p>That I must stoop ere I can give the blow.</p>
<p>But mine is fixed so far above thy crown,</p>
<p>That all thy men,</p>
<p>Piled on thy back, can never pull it down.</p>
<p>But, at my ease, thy destiny I send,</p>
<p>By ceasing from this hour to be thy friend.</p>
<p>Like heaven, I need but only to stand still;</p>
<p>And, not concurring to thy life, I kill.</p>
<p>Thou canst no title to my duty bring;</p>
<p>I am not thy subject, and my soul's thy king.</p>
<p>Farewell! When I am gone,</p>
<p>There's not a star of thine dare stay with thee:</p>
<p>I'll whistle thy tame fortune after me;</p>
<p>And whirl fate with me wheresoe'er I fly,</p>
<p>As winds drive storms before them in the sky.</p>
</div>

<p>This curious passage did not escape the malicious criticism of
Settle, who, besides noticing the extravagant egotism of the hero,
questions, with some probability, whether Abdalla would have chosen
to scale Almanzor's fate, at the risque of the personal consequences
of having all his men piled on his own back. In the same
scene, Almanzor is so unreasonable as to tell his rival,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>&mdash;Thou shalt not dare</p>
<p>To be so impudent as to despair.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pgnm" id="page_006"></span>
And again,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>What are ten thousand subjects, such as they?</p>
<p>If I am scorned, I'll take myself away.</p>
</div>

<p>Dryden's apology for these extravagancies seems to be, that
Almanzor is in a passion. But, although talking nonsense is a
common effect of passion, it seems hardly one of those consequences
adapted to shew forth the character of a hero in theatrical
representation.</p>

<p>It must be owned, however, that although the part of Almanzor
contains these and other bombastic passages, there are many
also which convey what the poet desired to represent&mdash;the aspirations
of a mind so heroic as almost to surmount the bonds of society
and even the very laws of the universe, leaving us often in
doubt whether the vehemence of the wish does not even disguise the
impossibility of its accomplishment.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Good heaven! thy book of fate before me lay,</p>
<p>But to tear out the journal of this day.</p>
<p>Or, if the order of the world below</p>
<p>Will not the gap of one whole day allow,</p>
<p>Give me that minute when she made her vow.</p>
<p>That minute, even the happy from their bliss might give,</p>
<p>And those, who live in grief, a shorter time would live.</p>
<p>So small a link, if broke, the eternal chain</p>
<p>Would, like divided waters, join again.</p>
<p>It wonnot be; the fugitive is gone,</p>
<p>Pressed by the crowd of following minutes on:</p>
<p>That precious moment's out of nature fled,</p>
<p>And in the heap of common rubbish laid,</p>
<p>Of things that once have been, and now decayed.</p>
</div>

<p>In the less inflated parts, the ideas are usually as just, as ingenious
and beautiful; for example.</p>

<div class="poem"><table summary="No; there is a necessity in fate.">
<tr><td><p>No; there is a necessity in fate.</p>
<p>Why still the brave bold man is fortunate;</p>
<p>He keeps his object ever full in sight,</p>
<p>And that assurance holds him firm and right.</p>
<p>True, 'tis a narrow path that leads to bliss,</p>
<p>But right before there is no precipice;</p>
<p>Fear makes men look aside, and then their footing miss.</p></td>

<p>The character of Almanzor is well known as the original of
Drawcansir, in "The Rehearsal," into whose mouth parodies of some
of Dryden's most extravagant flights have been put by the duke of
Buckingham. Shaftesbury also, whose family had smarted under
<span class="pgnm" id="page_007"></span>
Dryden's satire, attempts to trace the applause bestowed on the
"Conquest of Granada" to what he calls "the correspondence
and relation between our <i>Royal Theatre</i> and popular <i>Circus</i>, or
<i>Bear-Garden</i>. For, in the former of these assemblys, 'tis undeniable
that, at least, the two upper regions, or galleries, contain such
spectators as indifferently frequent each place of sport. So that
'tis no wonder we hear such applause resounded on the victories
of an <i>Almanzor</i>, when the same parties had possibly no later than
the day before bestowed their applause as freely on the victorious
<i>Butcher</i>, the hero of another stage." <i>Miscellaneous Reflections.
Miscell. 5.</i></p>

<p>The other personages of the drama sink into Lilliputians, beside
the gigantic Almanzor, although the under plot of the loves of
Ozmyn and Benzayda is beautiful in itself, and ingeniously managed.
The virtuous Almahide is a fit object for the adoration of
Almanzor; but her husband is a poor pageant of royalty. As
for Lyndaraxa, her repeated and unparalleled treachery can only be
justified by the extreme imbecility of her lovers.</p>

<p>The plot of the play is, in part, taken from history. During
the last years of its existence, Granada, the poor remnant of the
Moorish empire in Spain, was torn to pieces with intestine discord,
and assailed without by the sword of the Christians. The history
of the civil wars of Granada, affirmed to be translated into Spanish
from the Arabian, gives a romantic, but not altogether fabulous
account of their discord. But a romance in the French taste,
called Almahide, seems to have been the chief source from which
our author drew his plot.</p>

<p>In the conduct of the story there is much brilliancy of event.
The reader, or spectator, is never allowed to repose on the scene
before him; and although the changes of fortune are too rapid to
be either probable, or altogether pleasing, yet they arrest the attention
by their splendour and importance, and interest us in spite
of our more sober judgment. The introduction of the ghost of
Almanzor's mother seems to have been intended to shew how the
hero could support even an interview with an inhabitant of the
other world. At least, the professed purpose of her coming
might have been safely trusted to the virtue of Almahide, and
her power over her lover. It afforded an opportunity, however,
to throw in some fine poetry, of which Dryden has not
failed to avail himself. Were it not a peculiar attribute of the
heroic drama, it might be mentioned as a defect, that during the
siege of the last possession of the Spanish Moors, by an enemy
hated for his religion, and for his success, the principle of patriotism
is hardly once alluded to through the whole piece. The fate, or
the wishes, of Almahide, Lyndaraxa, and Benzayda, are all that interest
<span class="pgnm" id="page_008"></span>
the Moorish warriors around them, as if the Christian was not
thundering at their gates, to exterminate at once their nation and
religion. Indeed, so essentially necessary are the encouragements
of beauty to military achievement, that we find queen Isabella ordering
to the field of battle a <i>corps de reserve</i> of her maids of honour
to animate the fighting warriors with their smiles, and counteract
the powerful charms of the Moorish damsels. Nor is it an
inferior fault, that, although the characters are called Moors, there
is scarce any expression, or allusion, which can fix the reader's
attention upon their locality, except an occasional interjection to
Alha, or Mahomet.</p>

<p>If, however, the reader can abstract his mind from the qualities
now deemed essential to a play, and consider the Conquest of Granada
as a piece of romantic poetry, there are few compositions in
the English language, which convey a more lively and favourable
display of the magnificence of fable, of language, and of action,
proper to that style of composition. Amid the splendid ornaments
of the structure we lose sight of occasional disproportion
and incongruity; and, at an early age particularly, there are few
poems which make a more deep impression upon the imagination,
than the Conquest of Granada.</p>

<p>The two parts of this drama were brought out in the same season,
probably in winter, 1669, or spring, 1670. They were received
with such applause, that Langbaine conceives their success to have
been the occasion of Dryden's undervaluing his predecessors in
dramatic writing. The Conquest of Granada was not printed till
1672.</p>

<h3 class="chap">TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE<a class="ftnt" href="#Alman_2-1">[1]</a>.</h3>

<p class="smcap noind">Sir,</p>

<p>Heroic poesy has always been sacred to princes,
and to heroes. Thus Virgil inscribed his &AElig;neids to
Augustus C&aelig;sar; and of latter ages, Tasso and
Ariosto dedicated their poems to the house of Este.
It is indeed but justice, that the most excellent
and most profitable kind of writing should be addressed
by poets to such persons, whose characters
have, for the most part, been the guides and patterns
of their imitation; and poets, while they
imitate, instruct. The feigned hero inflames the
true; and the dead virtue animates the living.
Since, therefore, the world is governed by precept
and example, and both these can only have influence
from those persons who are above us; that
kind of poesy, which excites to virtue the greatest
men, is of the greatest use to human kind.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm" id="page_010"></span>
It is from this consideration, that I have presumed
to dedicate to your royal highness these faint
representations of your own worth and valour in
heroick poetry: Or, to speak more properly, not to
dedicate, but to restore to you those ideas, which
in the more perfect part of my characters I have taken
from you. Heroes may lawfully be delighted
with their own praises, both as they are farther incitements
to their virtue, and as they are the highest
returns which mankind can make them for it.</p>

<p>And certainly, if ever nation were obliged, either
by the conduct, the personal<a class="ftnt" href="#Alman_2-2">[2]</a> valour, or the good
fortune of a leader, the English are acknowledging,
in all of them, to your royal highness. Your whole
life has been a continued series of heroick actions;
which you began so early, that you were no sooner
named in the world, but it was with praise and admiration.
Even the first blossoms of your youth
paid us all that could be expected from a ripening
manhood. While you practised but the rudiments
of war, you out-went all other captains; and have
since found none to surpass, but yourself alone.
The opening of your glory was like that of light:
You shone to us from afar; and disclosed your
first beams on distant nations: Yet so, that the lustre
of them was spread abroad, and reflected brightly
on your native country. You were then an honour
<span class="pgnm" id="page_011"></span>
to it, when it was a reproach to itself. When
the fortunate usurper sent his arms to Flanders,
many of the adverse party were vanquished by your
fame, ere they tried your valour.<a class="ftnt" href="#Alman_2-3">[3]</a> The report of
it drew over to your ensigns whole troops and companies
of converted rebels, and made them forsake
successful wickedness, to follow an oppressed and
exiled virtue. Your reputation waged war with the
enemies of your royal family, even within their
trenches; and the more obstinate, or more guilty
of them, were forced to be spies over those whom
they commanded, lest the name of York should disband
that army, in whose fate it was to defeat the
Spaniards, and force Dunkirk to surrender. Yet,
those victorious forces of the rebels were not able
to sustain your arms. Where you charged in person
you were a conqueror. It is true, they afterwards
recovered courage; and wrested that victory
from others which they had lost to you; and it
was a greater action for them to rally, than it was
to overcome. Thus, by the presence of your royal
highness, the English on both sides remained victorious
and that army, which was broken by your
valour, became a terror to those for whom they conquered.
Then it was, that at the cost of other nations
you informed and cultivated that valour, which
was to defend your native country, and to vindicate
its honour from the insolence of our encroaching
neighbours. When the Hollanders, not contented
to withdraw themselves from the obedience which
they owed their lawful sovereign, affronted those by
<span class="pgnm" id="page_012"></span>
whose charity they were first protected; and, being
swelled up to a pre-eminence of trade, by a supine
negligence on our side, and a sordid parsimony
on their own, dared to dispute the sovereignty of
the seas, the eyes of three nations were then cast
upon you; and by the joint suffrage of king and
people, you were chosen to revenge their common
injuries; to which, though you had an undoubted
title by your birth, you had a greater by your courage.
Neither did the success deceive our hopes
and expectations: The most glorious victory which
was gained by our navy in that war, was in the first
engagement; wherein, even by the confession of
our enemies, who ever palliate their own losses, and
diminish our advantages, your absolute triumph was
acknowledged: You conquered at the Hague, as
entirely as at London; and the return of a shattered
fleet, without an admiral, left not the most
impudent among them the least pretence for a false
bonfire, or a dissembled day of public thanksgiving.
All our achievements against them afterwards,
though we sometimes conquered, and were never
overcome, were but a copy of that victory, and they
still fell short of their original: somewhat of fortune
was ever wanting, to fill up the title of so absolute
a defeat; or perhaps the guardian angel of
our nation was not enough concerned when you
were absent, and would not employ his utmost vigour
for a less important stake, than the life and
honour of a royal admiral.</p>

<p>And if, since that memorable day,<a class="ftnt" href="#Alman_2-4">[4]</a> you have had
leisure to enjoy in peace the fruits of so glorious a
<span class="pgnm" id="page_013"></span>
reputation; it was occasion only has been wanting
to your courage, for that can never be wanting to
occasion. The same ardour still incites you to heroick
actions, and the same concernment for all the
interests of your king and brother continues to give
you restless nights, and a generous emulation for
your own glory. You are still meditating on new
labours for yourself, and new triumphs for the nation;
and when our former enemies again provoke
us, you will again solicit fate to provide you another
navy to overcome, and another admiral to be slain.
You will then lead forth a nation eager to revenge
their past injuries; and, like the Romans, inexorable
to peace, till they have fully vanquished. Let
our enemies make their boast of a surprise,<a class="ftnt" href="#Alman_2-5">[5]</a> as the
Samnities did of a successful stratagem; but the
<i>Furc&aelig; Caudin&aelig;</i> will never be forgiven till they are
revenged. I have always observed in your royal
highness an extreme concernment for the honour
of your country; it is a passion common to you with
a brother, the most excellent of kings; and in your
two persons are eminent the characters which Homer
has given us of heroick virtue; the commanding
part in Agamemnon, and the executive in Achilles.
And I doubt not from both your actions,
but to have abundant matter to fill the annals of a
glorious reign, and to perform the part of a just historian
to my royal master, without intermixing with
it any thing of the poet.</p>

<p>In the mean time, while your royal highness is
preparing fresh employments for our pens, I have
been examining my own forces, and making trial of
myself, how I shall be able to transmit you to posterity.
<span class="pgnm" id="page_014"></span>
I have formed a hero, I confess, not absolutely
perfect, but of an excessive and over-boiling
courage; but Homer and Tasso are my precedents.
Both the Greek and the Italian poet had
well considered, that a tame hero, who never transgresses
the bounds of moral virtue, would shine but
dimly in an epic poem; the strictness of those rules
might well give precepts to the reader, but would
administer little of occasion to the writer. But a
character of an eccentrick virtue is the more exact
image of human life, because he is not wholly
exempted from its frailties; such a person is Almanzor,
whom I present, with all humility, to the
patronage of your royal highness. I designed in
him a roughness of character, impatient of injuries,
and a confidence of himself, almost approaching to
an arrogance. But these errors are incident only to
great spirits; they are moles and dimples, which
hinder not a face from being beautiful, though that
beauty be not regular; they are of the number of
those amiable imperfections which we see in mistresses,
and which we pass over without a strict
examination, when they are accompanied with
greater graces. And such in Almanzor are a frank
and noble openness of nature, an easiness to forgive
his conquered enemies, and to protect them in distress;
and, above all, an inviolable faith in his affection.</p>

<p>This, sir, I have briefly shadowed to your royal
highness, that you may not be ashamed of that
hero, whose protection you undertake. Neither
would I dedicate him to so illustrious a name, if I
were conscious to myself that he did or said any
thing which was wholly unworthy of it. However,
since it is not just that your royal highness should
defend or own what possibly may be my error, I
bring before you this accused Almanzor in the nature
<span class="pgnm" id="page_015"></span>
of a suspected criminal. By the suffrage
of the most and best he already is acquitted;
and by the sentence of some, condemned. But as
I have no reason to stand to the award of my enemies,
so neither dare I trust the partiality of my
friends: I make my last appeal to your royal highness,
as to a sovereign tribunal. Heroes should only
be judged by heroes; because they only are capable
of measuring great and heroick actions by the
rule and standard of their own. If Almanzor has
failed in any point of honour, I must therein acknowledge
that he deviates from your royal highness,
who are the pattern of it. But if at any time
he fulfils the parts of personal valour, and of conduct,
of a soldier, and of a general; or, if I could
yet give him a character more advantageous than
what he has, of the most unshaken friend, the greatest
of subjects, and the best of masters, I should
then draw to all the world a true resemblance of your
worth and virtues; at least, as far as they are capable
of being copied by the mean abilities of,</p>

<h3 class="chap">OF HEROIC PLAYS.</h3>

<h4 class="ctr">AN ESSAY.</h4>


<p>Whether heroic verse ought to be admitted into
serious plays, is not now to be disputed: it is already
in possession of the stage, and I dare confidently
affirm, that very few tragedies, in this age, shall be
received without it. All the arguments which are
formed against it, can amount to no more than this,
that it is not so near conversation as prose, and
therefore not so natural. But it is very clear to all
who understand poetry, that serious plays ought
not to imitate conversation too nearly. If nothing
were to be raised above that level, the foundation
of poetry would be destroyed. And if you once
admit of a latitude, that thoughts may be exalted,
and that images and actions may be raised above
the life, and described in measure without rhyme,
that leads you insensibly from your own principles
to mine: you are already so far onward of your
way, that you have forsaken the imitation of ordinary
converse. You are gone beyond it; and to
continue where you are, is to lodge in the open
<span class="pgnm" id="page_017"></span>
fields, betwixt two inns. You have lost that which
you call natural, and have not acquired the last
perfection of art. But it was only custom which
cozened us so long; we thought, because Shakespeare
and Fletcher went no farther, that there the
pillars of poetry were to be erected; that, because
they excellently described passion without rhime,
therefore rhime was not capable of describing it.
But time has now convinced most men of that error.
It is indeed so difficult to write verse, that
the adversaries of it have a good plea against many,
who undertook that task, without being formed by
art or nature for it. Yet, even they who have written
worst in it, would have written worse without
it: They have cozened many with their sound, who
never took the pains to examine their sense. In fine,
they have succeeded; though, it is true, they have
more dishonoured rhime by their good success, than
they have done by their ill. But I am willing to
let fall this argument: It is free for every man to
write, or not to write, in verse, as he judges it to
be, or not to be, his talent; or as he imagines the
audience will receive it.</p>

<p>For heroic plays, in which only I have used it
without the mixture of prose, the first light we had
of them, on the English theatre, was from the late
Sir William D'Avenant. It being forbidden him in
the rebellious times to act tragedies and comedies,
because they contained some matter of scandal to
those good people, who could more easily dispossess
their lawful sovereign, than endure a wanton jest,
he was forced to turn his thoughts another way,
and to introduce the examples of moral virtue, writ
in verse, and performed in recitative music. The
original of this music, and of the scenes which
adorned his work, he had from the Italian operas;
but he heightened his characters, as I may probably
<span class="pgnm" id="page_018"></span>
imagine, from the example of Corneille and
some French poets. In this condition did this part
of poetry remain at his majesty's return; when,
growing bolder, as being now owned by a public
authority, he reviewed his "Siege of Rhodes," and
caused it be acted as a just drama. But as few
men have the happiness to begin and finish any
new project, so neither did he live to make his design
perfect: There wanted the fulness of a plot,
and the variety of characters to form it as it ought;
and, perhaps, something might have been added to
the beauty of the style. All which he would have
performed with more exactness, had he pleased to
have given us another work of the same nature.
For myself and others, who come after him, we
are bound, with all veneration to his memory, to
acknowledge what advantage we received from that
excellent groundwork which he laid: And, since it
is an easy thing to add to what already is invented,
we ought all of us, without envy to him, or partiality
to ourselves, to yield him the precedence in
it.</p>

<p>Having done him this justice, as my guide, I
may do myself so much, as to give an account of
what I have performed after him. I observed then,
as I said, what was wanting to the perfection of his
"Siege of Rhodes;" which was design, and variety
of characters. And in the midst of this consideration
by mere accident, I opened the next book
that lay by me, which was "Ariosto," in Italian;
and the very first two lines of that poem gave me
light to all I could desire;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>Le donne, i cavalier, l'arme, gli amori,</i></p>
<p><i>Le cortesie, l'audaci imprese io canto,</i> &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>For the very next reflection which I made was this,
that an heroic play ought to be an imitation, in
<span class="pgnm" id="page_019"></span>
little, of an heroic poem; and, consequently, that
love and valour ought to be the subject of it. Both
these Sir William D'Avenant had begun to shadow;
but it was so, as first discoverers draw their maps,
with headlands, and promontories, and some few
outlines of somewhat taken at a distance, and which
the designer saw not clearly. The common drama
obliged him to a plot well formed and pleasant, or,
as the ancients call it, one entire and great action.
But this he afforded not himself in a story, which
he neither filled with persons, nor beautified with
characters, nor varied with accidents. The laws of
an heroic poem did not dispense with those of the
other, but raised them to a greater height, and indulged
him a farther liberty of fancy, and of drawing
all things as far above the ordinary proportion
of the stage, as that is beyond the common words
and actions of human life; and, therefore, in the
scanting of his images and design, he complied not
enough with the greatness and majesty of an heroic
poem.</p>

<p>I am sorry I cannot discover my opinion of this
kind of writing, without dissenting much from his,
whose memory I love and honour. But I will do
it with the same respect to him, as if he were now
alive, and overlooking my paper while I write. His
judgment of an heroic poem was this: "That it
ought to be dressed in a more familiar and easy
shape; more fitted to the common actions and passions
of human life; and, in short, more like a glass
of nature, shewing us ourselves in our ordinary habits
and figuring a more practicable virtue to us,
than was done by the ancients or moderns." Thus
he takes the image of an heroic poem from the
drama, or stage poetry; and accordingly intended
to divide it into five books, representing the same
<span class="pgnm" id="page_020"></span>
number of acts; and every book into several cantos,
imitating the scenes which compose our acts.</p>

<p>But this, I think, is rather a play in narration, as
I may call it, than an heroic poem. If at least you
will not prefer the opinion of a single man to the
practice of the most excellent authors, both of ancient
and latter ages. I am no admirer of quotations;
but you shall hear, if you please, one of the
ancients delivering his judgment on this question;
it is Petronius Arbiter, the most elegant, and one of
the most judicious authors of the Latin tongue;
who, after he had given many admirable rules for
the structure and beauties of an epic poem, concludes
all in these following words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"Non enim res gest&aelig; versibus comprehendend&aelig;
sunt, quod longe melius historici faciunt: sed, per ambages
deorumque ministeria, pr&aelig;cipitanaus est liber
spiritus, ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat,
quam religios&aelig; orationis, sub testibus, fides."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In which sentence, and his own essay of a poem,
which immediately he gives you, it is thought he
taxes Lucan, who followed too much the truth of
history, crowded sentences together, was too full of
points, and too often offered at somewhat which
had more of the sting of an epigram, than of the
dignity and state of an heroic poem. Lucan used
not much the help of his heathen deities: There
was neither the ministry of the gods, nor the precipitation
of the soul, nor the fury of a prophet (of
which my author speaks), in his <i>Pharsalia</i>; he treats
you more like a philosopher than a poet, and instructs
you in verse, with what he had been taught
by his uncle Seneca in prose. In one word, he walks
soberly afoot, when he might fly. Yet Lucan is not
always this religious historian. The oracle of Appius
and the witchcraft of Erictho, will somewhat
atone for him, who was, indeed, bound up by an ill-chosen
<span class="pgnm" id="page_021"></span>
and known argument, to follow truth with
great exactness. For my part, I am of opinion, that
neither Homer, Virgil, Statius, Ariosto, Tasso, nor
our English Spencer, could have formed their poems
half so beautiful, without those gods and spirits,
and those enthusiastic parts of poetry, which compose
the most noble parts of all their writings. And
I will ask any man who loves heroic poetry (for I
will not dispute their tastes who do not), if the
ghost of Polydorus in Virgil, the Enchanted Wood
in Tasso, and the Bower of Bliss in Spencer (which
he borrows from that admirable Italian) could have
been omitted, without taking from their works
some of the greatest beauties in them. And if any
man object the improbabilities of a spirit appearing,
or of a palace raised by magic; I boldly answer
him, that an heroic poet is not tied to a bare representation
of what is true, or exceeding probable;
but that he may let himself loose to visionary objects
and to the representation of such things, as,
depending not on sense, and therefore not to be
comprehended by knowledge, may give him a freer
scope for imagination. It is enough that, in all ages
and religions, the greatest part of mankind have
believed the power of magic, and that there are spirits
or spectres which have appeared. This, I say,
is foundation enough for poetry; and I dare farther
affirm, that the whole doctrine of separated beings,
whether those spirits are incorporeal substances,
(which Mr Hobbes, with some reason, thinks to imply
a contradiction) or that they are a thinner and
more a&euml;rial sort of bodies, (as some of the fathers
have conjectured) may better be explicated by poets
than by philosophers or divines. For their speculations
on this subject are wholly poetical; they
have only their fancy for their guide; and that, being
sharper in an excellent poet, than it is likely it
<span class="pgnm" id="page_022"></span>
should in a phlegmatic, heavy gownman, will see
farther in its own empire, and produce more satisfactory
notions on those dark and doubtful problems.</p>

<p>Some men think they have raised a great argument
against the use of spectres and magic in heroic
poetry, by saying they are unnatural; but whether
they or I believe there are such things, is not
material; it is enough that, for aught we know, they
may be in nature; and whatever is, or may be, is
not properly unnatural. Neither am I much concerned
at Mr Cowley's verses before "Gondibert,"
though his authority is almost sacred to me: It is
true, he has resembled the old epic poetry to a fantastic
fairy-land; but he has contradicted himself
by his own example: For he has himself made use
of angels and visions in his "Davideis," as well as
Tasso in his "Godfrey."</p>

<p>What I have written on this subject will not be
thought a digression by the reader, if he please to
remember what I said in the beginning of this essay,
that I have modelled my heroic plays by the
rules of an heroic poem. And if that be the most
noble, the most pleasant, and the most instructive
way of writing in verse, and withal the highest pattern
of human life, as all poets have agreed, I shall
need no other argument to justify my choice in this
imitation. One advantage the drama has above the
other, namely, that it represents to view what the
poem only does relate; and, <i>Segnius irritant animum
demissa per aures, quam qu&aelig; sunt oculis subjecta
fidelibus</i>, as Horace tells us.</p>

<p>To those who object my frequent use of drums
and trumpets, and my representations of battles, I
answer, I introduced them not on the English stage:
Shakespeare used them frequently; and though
Jonson shews no battle in his "Catiline," yet you hear
<span class="pgnm" id="page_023"></span>
from behind the scenes the sounding of trumpets,
and the shouts of fighting armies. But, I add farther,
that these warlike instruments, and even their
presentations of fighting on the stage, are no more
than necessary to produce the effects of an heroic
play; that is, to raise the imagination of the audience
and to persuade them, for the time, that what
they behold on the theatre is really performed. The
poet is then to endeavour an absolute dominion over
the minds of the spectators; for, though our fancy
will contribute to its own deceit, yet a writer ought
to help its operation: And that the Red Bull has
formerly done the same, is no more an argument
against our practice, than it would be for a physician
to forbear an approved medicine, because a
mountebank has used it with success.</p>

<p>Thus I have given a short account of heroic plays.
I might now, with the usual eagerness of an author,
make a particular defence of this. But the common
opinion (how unjust soever) has been so much
to my advantage, that I have reason to be satisfied,
and to suffer with patience all that can be urged
against it.</p>

<p>For, otherwise, what can be more easy for me,
than to defend the character of Almanzor, which
is one great exception that is made against the
play? 'Tis said, that Almanzor is no perfect pattern
of heroic virtue, that he is a contemner of kings,
and that he is made to perform impossibilities.</p>

<p>I must therefore avow, in the first place, from
whence I took the character. The first image I
had of him, was from the Achilles of Homer; the
next from Tasso's Rinaldo, (who was a copy of the
former) and the third from the Artaban of Monsieur
Calpranede, who has imitated both. The original
of these, Achilles, is taken by Homer for his hero;
and is described by him as one, who in strength
<span class="pgnm" id="page_024"></span>
and courage surpassed the rest of the Grecian army;
but, withal, of so fiery a temper, so impatient of an
injury, even from his king and general, that when
his mistress was to be forced from him by the command
of Agamemnon, he not only disobeyed it, but
returned him an answer full of contumely, and in
the most opprobrious terms he could imagine; they
are Homer's words which follow, and I have cited

<p>Tasso's chief character, Rinaldo, was a man of
the same temper; for, when he had slain Gernando
in his heat of passion, he not only refused to be
judged by Godfrey, his general, but threatened that
if he came to seize him, he would right himself by
arms upon him; witness these following lines of
Tasso:</p>

<div class="poem" style="font-style: italic">
<span class="pgnm" id="page_025"></span>
<p>Venga egli, o mundi, io terr&ograve; fermo il piede:</p>
<p>Giudici fian tra noi la sorte, e l'arme;</p>
<p>Fera tragedia vuol che s'appresenti,</p>
<p>Per lor diporto, alle nemiche genti.</p>
</div>

<p>You see how little these great authors did esteem
the point of honour, so much magnified by the
French, and so ridiculously aped by us. They made
their heroes men of honour; but so, as not to divest
them quite of human passions and frailties:
they content themselves to shew you, what men
of great spirits would certainly do when they were
provoked, not what they were obliged to do by the
strict rules of moral virtue. For my own part, I declare
myself for Homer and Tasso, and am more in love
with Achilles and Rinaldo, than with Cyrus and
Oroondates. I shall never subject my characters
to the French standard, where love and honour are
to be weighed by drams and scruples: Yet, where
I have designed the patterns of exact virtues, such
as in this play are the parts of Almahide, of Ozmyn,
and Benzayda, I may safely challenge the best of
theirs.</p>

<p>But Almanzor is taxed with changing sides: and
what tie has he on him to the contrary? He is
not born their subject whom he serves, and he is
injured by them to a very high degree. He threatens
them, and speaks insolently of sovereign power;
but so do Achilles and Rinaldo, who were subjects
and soldiers to Agamemnon and Godfrey of Bulloigne.
He talks extravagantly in his passion; but,
if I would take the pains to quote an hundred passages
of Ben Jonson's Cethegus, I could easily shew
you, that the rhodomontades of Almanzor are neither
so irrational as his, nor so impossible to be put
in execution; for Cethegus threatens to destroy
nature, and to raise a new one out of it; to kill all
the senate for his part of the action; to look Cato
<span class="pgnm" id="page_026"></span>
dead; and a thousand other things as extravagant
he says, but performs not one action in the play.</p>

<p>But none of the former calumnies will stick; and,
therefore, it is at last charged upon me, that Almanzor
does all things; or if you will have an absurd
accusation, in their nonsense who make it, that he
performs impossibilities: they say, that being a
stranger, he appeases two fighting factions, when
the authority of their lawful sovereign could not.
This is indeed the most improbable of all his actions,
but it is far from being impossible. Their king had
made himself contemptible to his people, as the history
of Granada tells us; and Almanzor, though a
stranger, yet was already known to them by his
gallantry in the Juego de torros, his engagement on
the weaker side, and more especially by the character
of his person and brave actions, given by Abdalla
just before; and, after all, the greatness of the
enterprise consisted only in the daring, for he had
the king's guards to second him: But we have read
both of C&aelig;sar, and many other generals, who have
not only calmed a mutiny with a word, but have
presented themselves single before an army of their
enemies; which upon sight of them has revolted
from their own leaders, and come over to their
trenches. In the rest of Almanzor's actions you see
him for the most part victorious; but the same fortune
has constantly attended many heroes, who
were not imaginary. Yet, you see it no inheritance
to him; for, in the first place, he is made a prisoner;
and, in the last, defeated, and not able to preserve
the city from being taken. If the history of
the late Duke of Guise be true, he hazarded more,
and performed not less in Naples, than Almanzor is
feigned to have done in Granada.</p>

<p>I have been too tedious in this apology; but to
make some satisfaction, I will leave the rest of my
play exposed to the criticks, without defence.
<span class="pgnm" id="page_027"></span>
The concernment of it is wholly passed from me,
and ought to be in them who have been favourable
to it, and are somewhat obliged to defend their opinions
That there are errors in it, I deny not;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Ast opere in tanto fas est obrepere somnum.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But I have already swept the stakes: and, with
the common good fortune of prosperous gamesters,
can be content to sit quietly; to hear my fortune
cursed by some, and my faults arraigned by others;
and to suffer both without reply.</p>

<div class="poem"><table summary="PROLOGUE TO THE FIRST PART">
<tr><td><p>This jest was first of the other house's making,</p>
<p>And, five times tried, has never failed of taking;</p>
<p>For 'twere a shame a poet should be killed</p>
<p>Under the shelter of so broad a shield.</p>
<p>This is that hat, whose very sight did win ye</p>
<p>To laugh and clap as though the devil were in ye.</p>
<p>As then, for Nokes, so now I hope you'll be</p>
<p>So dull, to laugh once more for love of me.</p>
<p>I'll write a play, says one, for I have got</p>
<p>A broad-brimmed hat, and waist-belt, towards a plot.</p>
<p>Says the other, I have one more large than that.</p>
<p>Thus they out-write each other&mdash;with a hat!</p>
<p>The brims still grew with every play they writ;</p>
<p>And grew so large, they covered all the wit.</p>
<p>Hat was the play; 'twas language, wit, and tale:</p>
<p>Like them that find meat, drink, and cloth in ale.</p>
<p>What dulness do these mongrel wits confess,</p>
<p>When all their hope is acting of a dress!</p>
<p>Thus, two the best comedians of the age</p>
<p>Must be worn out, with being blocks o' the stage;</p>
<p>Like a young girl, who better things has known,</p>
<p>Beneath their poet's impotence they groan.</p>
<p>See now what charity it was to save!</p>
<p>They thought you liked, what only you forgave;</p>
<p><span class="pgnm" id="page_031"></span>
And brought you more dull sense, dull sense much worse</p>
<p>Than brisk gay nonsense, and the heavier curse.</p>
<p>They bring old iron, and glass upon the stage,</p>
<p>To barter with the Indians of our age.</p>
<p>Still they write on, and like great authors show;</p>
<p>But 'tis as rollers in wet gardens grow</p>
<p>Heavy with dirt, and gathering as they go.</p>
<p>May none, who have so little understood,</p>
<p>To like such trash, presume to praise what's good!</p>
<p>And may those drudges of the stage, whose fate</p>
<p>Is damned dull farce more dully to translate,</p>
<p>Fall under that excise the state thinks fit</p>
<p>To set on all French wares, whose worst is wit.</p>
<p>French farce, worn out at home, is sent abroad;</p>
<p>And, patched up here, is made our English mode.</p>
<p>Henceforth, let poets, ere allowed to write,</p>
<p>Be searched, like duelists before they fight,</p>
<p>For wheel-broad hats, dull honour, all that chaff,</p>
<p>Which makes you mourn, and makes the vulgar laugh:</p>
<p>For these, in plays, are as unlawful arms,</p>
<p>As, in a combat, coats of mail, and charms.</p>

Whom I, in hope, already father call,<br />

The flying skirmish of the darted cane:<br />

But, when fierce bulls run loose upon the place,<br />
And our bold Moors their loves with danger grace,<br />
Then heat new-bends thy slacken'd nerves again,<br />
And a short youth runs warm through every vein.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aben.</span> I must confess the encounters of this day<br />
Warmed me indeed, but quite another way,&mdash;<br />
Not with the fire of youth; but generous rage,<br />
To see the glories of my youthful age<br />
So far out-done.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Abdelm.</span> Castile could never boast, in all its pride;<br />
A pomp so splendid, when the lists, set wide,<br />
Gave room to the fierce bulls, which wildly ran<br />
In Sierra Ronda, ere the war began;<br />
Who, with high nostrils snuffing up the wind,<br />
Now stood the champion of the savage kind.<br />
Just opposite, within the circled place,<br />
Ten of our bold Abencerrages race<br />
(Each brandishing his bull-spear in his hand,)<br />
Did their proud jennets gracefully command.<br />
On their steel'd heads their demi-lances wore<br />
Small pennons, which their ladies' colours bore.<br />
Before this troop did warlike Ozmyn go;<br />
Each lady, as he rode, saluting low;<br />
At the chief stands, with reverence more profound,<br />
His well-taught courser, kneeling, touched the ground;<br />
Thence raised, he sidelong bore his rider on,<br />
Still facing, till he out of sight was gone.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Boab.</span> You praise him like a friend; and I confess,<br />
His brave deportment merited no less.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Abdelm.</span> Nine bulls were launched by his victorious arm,<br />
Whose wary jennet, shunning still the harm,<br />
Seemed to attend the shock, and then leaped wide:<br />
Mean while, his dext'rous rider, when he spied<br />
The beast just stooping, 'twixt the neck and head<br />
His lance, with never-erring fury, sped.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_035"></span>
<span class="cnm">Aben.</span> My son did well, and so did Hamet too;<br />
Yet did no more than we were wont to do;<br />
But what the stranger did was more than man.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Abdelm.</span> He finished all those triumphs we began.<br />
One bull, with curled black head, beyond the rest,<br />
And dew-laps hanging from his brawny chest,<br />
With nodding front a while did daring stand,<br />
And with his jetty hoof spurned back the sand;<br />
Then, leaping forth, he bellowed out aloud:<br />
The amazed assistants back each other crowd,<br />
While monarch-like he ranged the listed field;<br />
Some tossed, some gored, some trampling down he killed.<br />
The ignobler Moors from far his rage provoke<br />
With woods of darts, which from his sides he shook.<br />
Mean time your valiant son, who had before<br />
Gained fame, rode round to every Mirador;<br />
Beneath each lady's stand a stop he made,<br />
And, bowing, took the applauses which they paid.<br />
Just in that point of time, the brave unknown<br />
Approached the lists.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Boab.</span> I marked him, when alone<br />
(Observed by all, himself observing none)<br />
He entered first, and with a graceful pride<br />
His fiery Arab dextrously did guide,<br />
Who, while his rider every stand surveyed,<br />
Sprung loose, and flew into an escapade;<br />
Not moving forward, yet, with every bound,<br />
Pressing, and seeming still to quit his ground.<br />
What after passed<br />
Was far from the Ventanna where I sate,<br />
But you were near, and can the truth relate. <span class="sdr">[To <span class="cnm">Abdelm.</span></span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Abdelm.</span> Thus while he stood, the bull, who saw his foe,<br />
His easier conquests proudly did forego;<br />
<span class="pgnm" id="page_036"></span>
And, making at him with a furious bound,<br />
From his bent forehead aimed a double wound.<br />
A rising murmur ran through all the field,<br />
And every lady's blood with fear was chilled:<br />
Some shrieked, while others, with more helpful care,<br />
Cried out aloud,&mdash;Beware, brave youth, beware!<br />
At this he turned, and, as the bull drew near,<br />
Shunned, and received him on his pointed spear:<br />
The lance broke short, the beast then bellowed loud,<br />
And his strong neck to a new onset bowed.<br />
The undaunted youth<br />
Then drew; and, from his saddle bending low,<br />
Just where the neck did to the shoulders grow,<br />
With his full force discharged a deadly blow.<br />
Not heads of poppies (when they reap the grain)<br />
Fall with more ease before the labouring swain,<br />
Than fell this head:<br />
It fell so quick, it did even death prevent,<br />
And made imperfect bellowings as it went.<br />
Then all the trumpets victory did sound,<br />
And yet their clangors in our shouts were drown'd.

<div class="stanza" style="font-style: italic">
<p class="i1">Beneath a myrtle shade,</p>
<p>Which love for none, but happy lovers made,</p>
<p>I slept; and straight my love before me brought</p>
<p>Phyllis, the object of my waking thought.</p>
<p>Undressed she came my flames to meet,</p>
<p>While love strewed flowers beneath her feet;</p>
<p>Flowers which, so pressed by her, became more sweet.</p>
</div>

<h5>II.</h5>

<div class="stanza" style="font-style: italic">
<p class="i1">From the bright vision's head</p>

From her white temples fell her shaded hair</p>
<p>Like cloudy sunshine, not too brown nor fair;</p>
<p>Her hands, her lips, did love inspire;</p>
<p>Her every grace my heart did fire:</p>
<p>But most her eyes, which languished with desire.</p>

<h5>III.</h5>

<div class="stanza" style="font-style: italic">
<p class="i1">Ah, charming fair, said I,</p>
<p>How long can you my bliss and yours deny?</p>
<p>By nature and by love, this lonely shade</p>

<p>Silence and shades with love agree;</p>
<p>Both shelter you and favour me:</p>
<p>You cannot blush, because I cannot see.</p>

<p>Then die, said I: She still denied;</p>

<p>Wherever I am, and whatever I do,</p>
<p class="i1">My Phyllis is still in my mind;</p>
<p>When angry, I mean not to Phyllis to go,</p>
<p class="i1">My feet, of themselves, the way find:</p>
<p>Unknown to myself I am just at her door,</p>
<p>And, when I would rail, I can bring out no more</p>

<p>Sometimes a sad dream does delude my sad mind;</p>
<p>But, alas! when I wake, and no Phyllis I find,</p>
<p class="i1">How I sigh to myself all alone!</p>

So vain to you, and troublesome to me,<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Almah.</span> Why do you thus my secret thoughts pursue,<br />
Which, known, hurt me, and cannot profit you?<br />
Your knowledge but new troubles does prepare,<br />
Like theirs who curious in their fortunes are.<br />
To say, I could with more content be yours,<br />
Tempts you to hope; but not that hope assures.<br />
For since the king has right,<br />
And favoured by my father in his suit,<br />
It is a blossom which can bear no fruit.<br />
Yet, if you dare attempt so hard a task,<br />
May you succeed; you have my leave to ask.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Almanz.</span> I can with courage now my hopes pursue,<br />

The rest are small, a father and a king!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Almah.</span> Great souls discern not when the leap's too wide,<br />
Because they only view the farther side.<br />

Why still the brave bold man is fortunate:<br />
He keeps his object ever full in sight,<br />
And that assurance holds him firm and right.<br />
True, 'tis a narrow path that leads to bliss,<br />
But right before there is no precipice:<br />
Fear makes men look aside, and then their footing miss.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Almah.</span> I do your merit all the right I can;<br />
Admiring virtue in a private man:

I only wish the king may grateful be,<br />

That you would somewhat of your fierceness hide&mdash;<br />
That inborn fire&mdash;I do not call it pride?</p>

Let him but name the kingdom, 'tis his own.<br />
I am, but while I please, a private man;<br />
I have that soul which empires first began.<br />
From the dull crowd, which every king does lead,<br />

That crown, restored, deserves no recompence.<br />

Whate'er I owed you, this has cancelled all.</p>

I will not now, if thou wouldst beg me, stay;<br />

All rapid, is the hurricane of life.<br />
Had love not shewn me, I had never seen<br />
An excellence beyond Boabdelin.<br />

I had not, aiming higher, lost my rest;<br />
But with a vulgar good been dully blest:<br />
But, in Almanzor, having seen what's rare,<br />

And, like a favourite quickly in disgrace,<br />
Just knew the value ere I lost the place.</p>

I'll rather lose my life than thank him for't.</p>

She would repent; you push the quarrel on,<br />

To recompense me for the loss of you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Almah</span>, Heaven will reward your worth some better way:<br />
At least, for me, you have but lost one day.<br />
Nor is't a real loss which you deplore;<br />
You sought a heart that was engaged before.<br />
'Twas a swift love which took you in his way;<br />
Flew only through your heart, but made no stay:<br />
'Twas but a dream, where truth had not a place;<br />
A scene of fancy, moved so swift a pace,<br />
And shifted, that you can but think it was;&mdash;<br />

Would you conclude<br />
There had been none, because the burning's past?</p>

You should have blown up some to save the rest:<br />
But 'tis, at worst, but so consumed by fire,<br />

Build love a nobler temple in my place;<br />
You'll find the fire has but enlarged your space.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Almanz.</span> Love has undone me; I am grown so poor,<br />
I sadly view the ground I had before,<br />
But want a stock, and ne'er can build it more.</p>

I would contribute if I knew but how.<br />
Take friendship; or, if that too small appear,<br />
Take love,&mdash;which sisters may to brothers bear.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Almanz.</span> A sister's love! that is so palled a thing,<br />
What pleasure can it to a lover bring?<br />
'Tis like thin food to men in fevers spent;<br />
Just keeps alive, but gives no nourishment.<br />
What hopes, what fears, what transports can it move?<br />
'Tis but the ghost of a departed love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Almah.</span> You, like some greedy cormorant, devour<br />
All my whole life can give you in an hour.<br />
What more I can do for you is to die,<br />

You, in refusing life, my sentence give.</p>

I'll live for you, in spite of misery;<br />

Like gasps in death, which but prolong our pain.<br />
But, since the king is now a part of me,<br />
Cease from henceforth to be his enemy.<br />
Go now, for pity go! for, if you stay,<br />

<h3 class="chap">EPILOGUE.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<p>Success, which can no more than beauty last,</p>
<p>Makes our sad poet mourn your favours past:</p>
<p>For, since without desert he got a name,</p>
<p>He fears to lose it now with greater shame.</p>
<p>Fame, like a little mistress of the town,</p>
<p>Is gained with ease, but then she's lost as soon:</p>
<p>For, as those tawdry misses, soon or late,</p>
<p>Jilt such as keep them at the highest rate;</p>
<p>And oft the lacquey, or the brawny clown,</p>
<p>Gets what is hid in the loose-bodied gown,&mdash;</p>
<p>So, fame is false to all that keep her long;</p>
<p>And turns up to the fop that's brisk and young.</p>
<p>Some wiser poet now would leave fame first;</p>
<p>But elder wits are, like old lovers, cursed:</p>
<p>Who, when the vigour of their youth is spent,</p>
<p>Still grow more fond, as they grow impotent.</p>
<p>This, some years hence, our poet's case may prove;</p>
<p>But yet, he hopes, he's young enough to love.</p>
<p>When forty comes, if e'er he live to see</p>
<p>That wretched, fumbling age of poetry,</p>
<p>'Twill be high time to bid his muse adieu:&mdash;</p>
<p>Well may he please himself, but never you.</p>
<p>Till then, he'll do as well as he began,</p>
<p>And hopes you will not find him less a man.</p>
<p>Think him not duller for this year's delay;</p>
<p>He was prepared, the women were away;</p>
<p>And men, without their parts, can hardly play.</p>
<p>If they, through sickness, seldom did appear,</p>
<p>Pity the virgins of each theatre:</p>
<p>For, at both houses, 'twas a sickly year!</p>
<p>And pity us, your servants, to whose cost,</p>
<p>In one such sickness, nine whole months are lost.</p>
<p>Their stay, he fears, has ruined what he writ:</p>
<p>Long waiting both disables love and wit.</p>
<p>They thought they gave him leisure to do well;</p>
<p>But, when they forced him to attend, he fell!</p>
<p>Yet, though he much has failed, he begs, to-day,</p>
<p>You will excuse his unperforming play:</p>
<p>Weakness sometimes great passion does express;</p>
<p>He had pleased better, had he loved you less.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>They, who write ill, and they, who ne'er durst write,</p>
<p>Turn critics, out of mere revenge and spite:</p>
<p>A playhouse gives them fame; and up there starts,</p>
<p>From a mean fifth-rate wit, a man of parts.</p>
<p>(So common faces on the stage appear;</p>
<p>We take them in, and they turn beauties here.)</p>
<p>Our author fears those critics as his fate;</p>
<p>And those he fears, by consequence must hate,</p>
<p>For they the traffic of all wit invade,</p>
<p>As scriveners draw away the bankers' trade.</p>
<p>Howe'er, the poet's safe enough to day,</p>
<p>They cannot censure an unfinished play.</p>
<p>But, as when vizard-mask appears in pit,</p>
<p>Straight every man, who thinks himself a wit,</p>
<p>Perks up, and, managing his comb with grace,</p>
<p>With his white wig sets off his nut-brown face;</p>
<p>That done, bears up to th' prize, and views each limb,</p>
<p>To know her by her rigging and her trim;</p>
<p>Then, the whole noise of fops to wagers go,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Pox on her, 'tmust be she;" and&mdash;"damme, no!"&mdash;</p>
<p>Just, so, I prophesy, these wits to-day</p>
<p>Will blindly guess at our imperfect play;</p>
<p>With what new plots our Second Part is filled,</p>
<p>Who must be kept alive, and who be killed.</p>
<p>And as those vizard-masks maintain that fashion,</p>
<p>To soothe and tickle sweet imagination;</p>
<p>So our dull poet keeps you on with masking,</p>
<p>To make you think there's something worth your asking.</p>
<p>But, when 'tis shown, that, which does now delight you,</p>
<p>Will prove a dowdy, with a face to fright you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">K. Ferd.</span> At length the time is come, when Spain shall be<br />
From the long yoke of Moorish tyrants free.<br />
All causes seem to second our design,<br />
And heaven and earth in their destruction join.<br />
When empire in its childhood first appears,<br />
A watchful fate o'ersees its tender years;<br />
Till, grown more strong, it thrusts and stretches out,<br />
And elbows all the kingdoms round about:<br />
The place thus made for its first breathing free,<br />
It moves again for ease and luxury;<br />
<span class="pgnm" id="page_116"></span>
Till, swelling by degrees, it has possessed<br />
The greater space, and now crowds up the rest;<br />
When, from behind, there starts some petty state,<br />
And pushes on its now unwieldy fate;<br />
Then down the precipice of time it goes,<br />
And sinks in minutes, which in ages rose.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Q. Isabel.</span> Should bold Columbus in his search succeed,<br />
And find those beds in which bright metals breed;<br />
Tracing the sun, who seems to steal away,<br />
That, miser-like, he might alone survey<br />
The wealth which he in western mines did lay,&mdash;<br />
Not all that shining ore could give my heart<br />
The joy, this conquered kingdom will impart;<br />
Which; rescued from these misbelievers' hands,<br />
Shall now, at once, shake off its double bands:<br />
At once to freedom and true faith restored,<br />
Its old religion and its ancient lord.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">K. Ferd.</span> By that assault which last we made, I find,<br />
Their courage is with their success declined:<br />
Almanzor's absence now they dearly buy,<br />
Whose conduct crowned their arms with victory.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alonzo.</span> Their king himself did their last sally guide;<br />
I saw him, glistering in his armour, ride<br />
To break a lance in honour of his bride:<br />
But other thoughts now fill his anxious breast;<br />
Care of his crown his love has dispossest.</p>

<p class="sdn">To them <span class="cnm">Abdalla.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Q. Isabel.</span> But see, the brother of the Moorish king:<br />

<h3 class="chap">EPILOGUE.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<p>They, who have best succeeded on the stage,</p>
<p>Have still conformed their genius to their age.</p>
<p>Thus Jonson did mechanic humour show,</p>
<p>When men were dull, and conversation low.</p>
<p>Then comedy was faultless, but 'twas coarse:</p>
<p>Cobb's tankard was a jest, and Otter's horse<a class="ftnt" href="#Alman_5-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>And, as their comedy, their love was mean;</p>
<p>Except, by chance, in some one laboured scene,</p>
<p>Which must atone for an ill-written play.</p>
<p>They rose, but at their height could seldom stay.</p>
<p>Fame then was cheap, and the first comer sped;</p>
<p>And they have kept it since, by being dead.</p>
<p>But, were they now to write, when critics weigh</p>
<p>Each line, and every word, throughout a play,</p>
<p>None of them, no not Jonson in his height,</p>
<p>Could pass, without allowing grains for weight.</p>
<p>Think it not envy, that these truths are told;</p>
<p>Our poet's not malicious, though he's bold.</p>
<p>'Tis not to brand them, that their faults are shown,</p>
<p>But, by their errors, to excuse his own.</p>
<p>If love and honour now are higher raised,</p>
<p>'Tis not the poet, but the age is praised.</p>
<p>Wit's now arrived to a more high degree;</p>
<p>Our native language more refined and free.</p>
<p>Our ladies and our men now speak more wit</p>
<p>In conversation, than those poets writ.</p>
<p>Then, one of these is, consequently, true;</p>
<p>That what this poet writes comes short of you,</p>
<p>And imitates you ill (which most he fears),</p>
<p>Or else his writing is not worse than theirs.</p>
<p>Yet, though you judge (as sure the critics will),</p>
<p>That some before him writ with greater skill,</p>
<p>In this one praise he has their fame surpast,</p>
<p>To please an age more gallant than the last.</p>

<h3 class="chap">DEFENCE
OF
THE EPILOGUE;</h3>

<p class="ctr">OR,</p>

<h4 class="ctr">AN ESSAY ON THE DRAMATIC POETRY
OF THE LAST AGE.</h4>

<p>The promises of authors, that they will write
again, are, in effect, a threatening of their readers
with some new impertinence; and they, who perform
not what they promise, will have their pardon
on easy terms. It is from this consideration, that
I could be glad to spare you the trouble, which I
am now giving you, of a postscript, if I were not
obliged, by many reasons, to write somewhat concerning
our present plays, and those of our predecessors
on the English stage. The truth is, I have
so far engaged myself in a bold epilogue to this
play, wherein I have somewhat taxed the former
writing, that it was necessary for me either not to
print it, or to show that I could defend it. Yet I
would so maintain my opinion of the present age,
as not to be wanting in my veneration for the past:
<span class="pgnm" id="page_212"></span>
I would ascribe to dead authors their just praises in
those things wherein they have excelled us; and in
those wherein we contend with them for the pre-eminence,
I would acknowledge our advantages to
the age, and claim no victory from our wit. This
being what I have proposed to myself, I hope I
shall not be thought arrogant when I enquire into
their errors: For we live in an age so sceptical, that
as it determines little, so it takes nothing from antiquity
on trust; and I profess to have no other
ambition in this essay, than that poetry may not
go backward, when all other arts and sciences are
advancing. Whoever censures me for this inquiry,
let him hear his character from Horace:</p>

<div class="poem" style="font-style: italic">
<p>Ingeniis non ille favet, plauditque sepultis,</p>
<p>Nostra sed impugnat; nos nostraque lividus odit.</p>

<p><br />He favours not dead wits, but hates the living.</p>
</div>

<p>It was upbraided to that excellent poet, that he
was an enemy to the writings of his predecessor
Lucilius, because he had said, <i>Lucilium lutulentum
fluere</i>, that he ran muddy; and that he ought to
have retrenched from his satires many unnecessary
verses. But Horace makes Lucilius himself to justify
him from the imputation of envy, by telling
you that he would have done the same, had he lived
in an age which was more refined:</p>

<div class="poem" style="font-style: italic">
<p>Si foret hoc nostrum fato delapsus in &aelig;vum,</p>
<p>Detereret sibi multa, recideret omne quod, ultra</p>
<p>Perfectum traheretur, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">And, both in the whole course of that satire, and
in his most admirable Epistle to Augustus, he makes
it his business to prove, that antiquity alone is no
plea for the excellency of a poem; but that, one
age learning from another, the last (if we can suppose
an equality of wit in the writers,) has the advantage
<span class="pgnm" id="page_213"></span>
of knowing more and better than the former
And this, I think, is the state of the question
in dispute. It is therefore my part to make it
clear, that the language, wit, and conversation of
our age, are improved and refined above the last;
and then it will not be difficult to infer, that our
plays have received some part of those advantages.</p>

<p>In the first place, therefore, it will be necessary
to state, in general, what this refinement is, of
which we treat; and that, I think, will not be defined
amiss, "An improvement of our Wit, Language
and Conversation; or, an alteration in them
for the better."</p>

<p>To begin with Language. That an alteration is
lately made in ours, or since the writers of the last
age (in which I comprehend Shakespeare, Fletcher,
and Jonson), is manifest. Any man who reads
those excellent poets, and compares their language
with what is now written, will see it almost in every
line; but that this is an improvement of the language
or an alteration for the better, will not so
easily be granted. For many are of a contrary opinion
that the English tongue was then in the
height of its perfection; that from Jonson's time
to ours it has been in a continual declination, like
that of the Romans from the age of Virgil to Statius,
and so downward to Claudian; of which, not
only Petronius, but Quintilian himself so much
complains, under the person of <i>Secundus</i>, in his famous
dialogue <i>De Causis corrupt&aelig; Eloquenti&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>But, to shew that our language is improved, and
that those people have not a just value for the age
in which they live, let us consider in what the refinement
of a language principally consists: that is,
"either in rejecting such old words, or phrases,
which are ill sounding, or improper; or in admitting
<span class="pgnm" id="page_214"></span>
new, which are more proper, more sounding,
and more significant."</p>

<p>The reader will easily take notice, that when I
speak of rejecting improper words and phrases, I
mention not such as are antiquated by custom only
and, as I may say, without any fault of theirs.
For in this case the refinement can be but accidental;
that is, when the words and phrases, which are
rejected, happen to be improper. Neither would I
be understood, when I speak of impropriety of language,
either wholly to accuse the last age, or to
excuse the present, and least of all myself; for all
writers have their imperfections and failings: but I
may safely conclude in the general, that our improprieties
are less frequent, and less gross than theirs.
One testimony of this is undeniable, that we are the
first who have observed them; and, certainly, to observe
errors is a great step to the correcting of
them. But, malice and partiality set apart, let any
man, who understands English, read diligently the
works of Shakespeare and Fletcher, and I dare undertake,
that he will find in every page either some
solecism of speech, or some notorious flaw in sense<a class="ftnt" href="#Almanz_6-1">[1]</a>;
and yet these men are reverenced, when we are not
forgiven. That their wit is great, and many times
their expressions noble, envy itself cannot deny.</p>

<div class="poem" style="font-style: italic">
<p>&mdash;Neque ego illis detrahere ausim</p>
<p>H&aelig;rentem capiti mult&acirc; cum laude coronam.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">But the times were ignorant in which they lived.
Poetry was then, if not in its infancy among us, at
least not arrived to its vigour and maturity: Witness
<span class="pgnm" id="page_215"></span>
the lameness of their plots; many of which,
especially those which they writ first (for even
that age refined itself in some measure), were made
up of some ridiculous incoherent story, which in
one play many times took up the business of an
age. I suppose I need not name "Pericles, Prince
of Tyre," nor the historical plays of Shakespeare:
besides many of the rest, as the "Winter's Tale,"
"Love's Labour Lost," "Measure for Measure,"
which were either grounded on impossibilities, or
at least so meanly written, that the comedy neither
caused your mirth, nor the serious part your concernment<a class="ftnt" href="#Almanz_6-2">[2]</a>.
If I would expatiate on this subject,
I could easily demonstrate, that our admired Fletcher,
who wrote after him, neither understood correct
plotting, nor that which they call "the decorum
of the stage." I would not search in his worst
plays for examples: He who will consider his "Philaster,"
his "Humorous Lieutenant," his "Faithful
Shepherdess," and many others which I could name,
will find them much below the applause which is
now given them. He will see Philaster wounding
his mistress, and afterwards his boy, to save himself;
not to mention the Clown, who enters immediately,
and not only has the advantage of the combat
against the hero, but diverts you from your serious
concernment, with his ridiculous and absurd
raillery. In his "Humorous Lieutenant," you find
his Demetrius and Leontius staying in the midst of
a routed army, to hear the cold mirth of the Lieutenant;
and Demetrius afterwards appearing with
<span class="pgnm" id="page_216"></span>
a pistol in his hand, in the next age to Alexander
the Great<a class="ftnt" href="#Almanz_6-3">[3]</a>. And for his Shepherd, he falls
twice into the former indecency of wounding women.
But these absurdities, which those poets committed,
may more properly be called the age's fault
than theirs. For, besides the want of education
and learning, (which was their particular unhappiness)
they wanted the benefit of converse: But of
that I shall speak hereafter, in a place more proper
for it. Their audiences knew no better; and therefore
were satisfied with what they brought. Those,
who call theirs the golden age of poetry, have only
this reason for it, that they were then content with
acorns before they knew the use of bread; or that
<span class="Greek" title="Alis druos">
&alpha;&lambda;&iota;&sigmaf;
&delta;&rho;&upsilon;&omicron;&sigmaf;
</span> was become a proverb. They had many
who admired them, and few who blamed them;
and certainly a severe critic is the greatest help to
a good wit: he does the office of a friend, while he
designs that of an enemy; and his malice keeps a
poet within those bounds, which the luxuriancy of
his fancy would tempt him to overleap.</p>

<p>But it is not their plots which I meant principally
to tax; I was speaking of their sense and language;
and I dare almost challenge any man to
shew me a page together which is correct in both.
As for Ben Jonson, I am loth to name him, because
he is a most judicious writer; yet he very often falls
into these errors: and I once more beg the reader's
pardon for accusing him of them. Only let him
consider, that I live in an age where my least faults
are severely censured; and that I have no way left
<span class="pgnm" id="page_217"></span>
to extenuate my failings, but by showing as great
in those whom we admire:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>C&aelig;dimus, inque vicem pr&aelig;bemus crura sagittis.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="noind">I cast my eyes but by chance on Catiline; and in
the three or four last pages, found enough to conclude
that Jonson writ not correctly.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>&mdash;Let the long-hid seeds</p>
<p>Of treason, in thee, now shoot forth in deeds</p>
<p>Ranker than horror.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">In reading some bombast speeches of Macbeth,
which are not to be understood, he used to say that
it was horror; and I am much afraid that this is
so.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Thy parricide late on thy only son,</p>
<p>After his mother, to make empty way</p>
<p>For thy last wicked nuptials, worse than they</p>
<p>That blaze that act of thy incestuous life,</p>
<p>Which gained thee at once a daughter and a wife.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">The sense is here extremely perplexed; and I doubt
the word <i>they</i> is false grammar.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>&mdash;And be free</p>
<p>Not heaven itself from thy impiety.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">A synchysis, or ill-placing of words, of which Tully
so much complains in oratory.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>The waves and dens of beasts could not receive</p>
<p>The bodies that those souls were frighted <i>from</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">The preposition in the end of the sentence; a common
fault with him, and which I have but lately
observed in my own writings.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>What all the several ills that visit earth,</p>
<p>Plague, famine, fire, could not reach <i>unto</i>,</p>
<p>The sword, nor surfeits, let thy fury do.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind"><span class="pgnm" id="page_218"></span>
Here are both the former faults: for, besides that
the preposition <i>unto</i> is placed last in the verse, and
at the half period, and is redundant, there is the
former synchysis in the words "the sword, nor surfeits"
which in construction ought to have been
placed before the other.</p>

<p>Catiline says of Cethegus, that for his sake he
would</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>Go on upon</i> the gods, kiss lightning, wrest</p>
<p>The engine from the Cyclops, and <i>give fire</i></p>
<p><i>At face of a full cloud</i>, and stand <i>his ire</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">To "go on upon," is only to go on twice<a class="ftnt" href="#Almanz_6-4">[4]</a>. To
"give fire at face of a full cloud," was not understood
in his own time; "and stand <i>his ire</i>," besides
the antiquated word <i>ire</i>, there is the article <i>his</i>,
which makes false construction: and giving fire at
the face of a cloud, is a perfect image of shooting,
however it came to be known in those days to Catiline.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>&mdash;Others there are,</p>
<p>Whom envy to the state draws and pulls on,</p>
<p>For contumelies received; and such are sure <i>ones</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind"><i>Ones</i>, in the plural number: but that is frequent
with him; for he says, not long after,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>C&aelig;sar and Crassus, if they be ill men,</p>
<p>Are mighty <i>ones</i>.</p>
<p>Such men, <i>they</i> do not succour more the cause, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind"><i>They</i> redundant.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Though heaven should speak with all <i>his</i> wrath at once,</p>
<p>We should stand upright and <i>unfeared</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pgnm" id="page_219"></span>
<i>His</i> is ill syntax with <i>heaven</i>; and by <i>unfeared</i>
he means <i>unafraid</i>: Words of a quite contrary signification.</p>

<p>"The ports are open." He perpetually uses ports
for gates; which is an affected error in him, to introduce
Latin by the loss of the English idiom;
as, in the translation of Tully's speeches, he usually
does.</p>

<p>Well-placing of words, for the sweetness of pronunciation
was not known till Mr Waller introduced
it; and, therefore, it is not to be wondered if
Ben Jonson has many such lines as these:</p>

<p>"But being bred up in his father's needy fortunes;
brought up in's sister's prostitution," &amp;c.</p>

<p>But meanness of expression one would think not
to be his error in a tragedy, which ought to be
more high and sounding than any other kind of
poetry; and yet, amongst others in "Catiline," I
find these four lines together:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>So Asia, thou art cruelly even</p>
<p>With us, for all the blows thee given;</p>
<p>When we, whose virtues conquered thee,</p>
<p>Thus by thy vices ruined be.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Be</i> there is false English for <i>are</i>; though the
rhyme hides it.</p>

<p>But I am willing to close the book, partly out of
veneration to the author, partly out of weariness to
pursue an argument which is so fruitful in so small
a compass. And what correctness, after this, can be
expected from Shakespeare or from Fletcher, who
wanted that learning and care which Jonson had?
I will, therefore, spare my own trouble of enquiring
into their faults; who, had they lived now, had
doubtless written more correctly. I suppose it will
be enough for me to affirm, (as I think I safely may)
that these, and the like errors, which I taxed in the
<span class="pgnm" id="page_220"></span>
most correct of the last age, are such into which
we do not ordinarily fall. I think few of our present
writers would have left behind them such a
line as this:</p>

<p>Contain your spirit in more stricter bounds.</p>
</div>

<p>But that gross way of two comparatives was then
ordinary; and, therefore, more pardonable in Jonson.</p>

<p>As for the other part of refining, which consists
in receiving new words and phrases, I shall not insist
much on it. It is obvious that we have admitted
many, some of which we wanted, and therefore
our language is the richer for them, as it would
be by importation of bullion: Others are rather ornamental
than necessary; yet, by their admission,
the language is become more courtly, and our
thoughts are better drest. These are to be found
scattered in the writers of our age, and it is not my
business to collect them. They, who have lately
written with most care, have, I believe, taken the
rule of Horace for their guide; that is, not to be
too hasty in receiving of words, but rather stay till
custom has made them familiar to us:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>Quern penes arbitrium est, et jus, et norma loquendi.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="noind">For I cannot approve of their way of refining,
who corrupt our English idiom by mixing it too
much with French: That is a sophistication of language
not an improvement of it; a turning English
into French, rather than a refining of English
by French. We meet daily with those fops, who
value themselves on their travelling, and pretend
they cannot express their meaning in English, because
they would put off to us some French phrase
of the last edition; without considering, that, for
aught they know, we have a better of our own.
<span class="pgnm" id="page_221"></span>
But these are not the men who are to refine us;
their talent is to prescribe fashions, not words: at
best, they are only serviceable to a writer, so as Ennius
was to Virgil. He may <i>aurum ex stercore
colligere:</i> For it is hard if, amongst many insignificant
phrases, there happen not something worth
preserving; though they themselves, like Indians,
know not the value of their own commodity.</p>

<p>There is yet another way of improving language,
which poets especially have practised in all ages;
that is, by applying received words to a new signification;
and this, I believe, is meant by Horace,
in that precept which is so variously construed by
expositors:</p>

<div class="poem" style="font-style: italic">
<p>Dixeris egregie, notum si callida verbum</p>
<p>Reddiderit junctura novum.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">And, in this way, he himself had a particular happiness;
using all the tropes, and particular metaphors,
with that grace which is observable in his
Odes, where the beauty of expression is often greater
than that of thought; as, in that one example,
amongst an infinite number of others, "<i>Et vultus
nimium lubricus aspici.</i>"</p>

<p>And therefore, though he innovated a little, he
may justly be called a great refiner of the Roman
tongue. This choice of words, and heightening of
their natural signification, was observed in him by
the writers of the following ages; for Petronius
says of him, "<i>Et Horatii curiosa felicitas.</i>" By this
graffing, as I may call it, on old words, has our
tongue been beautified by the three before-mentioned
poets, Shakespeare, Fletcher, and Jonson, whose
excellencies I can never enough admire; and in this
they have been followed, especially by Sir John
Suckling and Mr Waller, who refined upon them.
Neither have they, who succeeded them, been wanting
<span class="pgnm" id="page_222"></span>
in their endeavours to adorn our mother tongue:
But it is not so lawful for me to praise my living
contemporaries, as to admire my dead predecessors.</p>

<p>I should now speak of the refinement of Wit;
but I have been so large on the former subject, that
I am forced to contract myself in this. I will
therefore only observe to you, that the wit of the
last age was yet more incorrect than their language.
Shakespeare, who many times has written better than
any poet, in any language, is yet so far from writing
wit always, or expressing that wit according to
the dignity of the subject, that he writes, in many
places, below the dullest writers of ours, or any precedent
age. Never did any author precipitate himself
from such height of thought to so low expressions,
as he often does. He is the very Janus of
poets; he wears almost every where two faces; and
you have scarce begun to admire the one, ere you
despise the other. Neither is the luxuriance of
Fletcher, which his friends have taxed in him, a
less fault than the carelessness of Shakespeare. He
does not well always; and, when he does, he is a
true Englishman,&mdash;he knows not when to give over.
If he wakes in one scene, he commonly slumbers
in another; and, if he pleases you in the first three
acts, he is frequently so tired with his labour, that
he goes heavily in the fourth, and sinks under his
burden in the fifth.</p>

<p>For Ben Jonson, the most judicious of poets,
he always writ properly, and as the character required;
and I will not contest farther with my friends,
who call that wit: it being very certain, that even
folly itself, well represented, is wit in a larger signification;
and that there is fancy, as well as judgment,
in it, though not so much or noble: because
all poetry being imitation, that of folly is a
lower exercise of fancy, though perhaps as difficult
<span class="pgnm" id="page_223"></span>
as the other; for it is a kind of looking downward
in the poet, and representing that part of mankind
which is below him.</p>

<p>In these low characters of vice and folly, lay the
excellency of that inimitable writer; who, when at
any time he aimed at wit in the stricter sense, that
is, sharpness of conceit, was forced either to borrow
from the ancients, as to my knowledge he did
very much from Plautus; or, when he trusted himself
alone, often fell into meanness of expression.
Nay, he was not free from the lowest and most
groveling kind of wit, which we call clenches, of
which "Every Man in his Humour" is infinitely
full; and, which is worse, the wittiest persons in
the drama speak them. His other comedies are not
exempt from them. Will you give me leave to
name some few? Asper, in which character he personates
himself, (and he neither was nor thought
himself a fool) exclaiming against the ignorant
judges of the age, speaks thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>How monstrous and detested is't, to see</p>
<p>A fellow, that has neither art nor brain,</p>
<p>Sit like an <i>Aristarchus</i>, or <i>stark-ass</i>,</p>
<p>Taking men's lines, with a <i>tobacco face</i>,</p>
<p>In <i>snuff</i>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">And presently after: "I marvel whose wit 'twas to
put a prologue in yond Sackbut's mouth. They
might well think he would be out of tune, and yet
you'd play upon him too."&mdash;Will you have another
of the same stamp? "O, I cannot abide these limbs
of <i>sattin</i>, or rather <i>Satan</i>."</p>

<p>But, it may be, you will object that this was Asper,
Macilente, or Carlo Buffone; you shall, therefore,
hear him speak in his own person, and that in
the two last lines, or sting of an epigram. It is inscribed
to <i>Fine Grand</i>, who, he says, was indebted
to him for many things which he reckons there;
and concludes thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span class="pgnm" id="page_224"></span>
Forty things more, dear <i>Grand</i>, which you know true,</p>
<p>For which, or pay me quickly, or I'll pay you.</p>
</div>

<p>This was then the mode of wit, the vice of the
age, and not Ben Jonson's; for you see, a little before
him, that admirable wit, Sir Philip Sidney, perpetually
playing with his words. In his time, I believe,
it ascended first into the pulpit, where (if you will
give me leave to clench too) it yet finds the benefit
of its clergy; for they are commonly the first corrupters
of eloquence, and the last reformed from vicious
oratory; as a famous Italian has observed before
me, in his Treatise of the Corruption of the Italian
Tongue; which he principally ascribes to priests
and preaching friars.</p>

<p>But, to conclude with what brevity I can, I will
only add this, in defence of our present writers,
that, if they reach not some excellencies of Ben
Jonson, (which no age, I am confident, ever shall)
yet, at least, they are above that meanness of
thought which I have taxed, and which is frequent
in him.</p>

<p>That the wit of this age is much more courtly,
may easily be proved, by viewing the characters of
gentlemen which were written in the last. First,
for Jonson:&mdash;True-wit, in the "Silent Woman,"
was his master-piece; and Truewit was a scholar-like
kind of man, a gentleman with an allay of pedantry,
a man who seems mortified to the world,
by much reading. The best of his discourse is
drawn, not from the knowledge of the town, but
books; and, in short, he would be a fine gentleman
in an university. Shakespeare shewed the best of
his skill in his Mercutio; and he said himself, that
he was forced to kill him in the third act, to prevent
being killed by him. But, for my part, I cannot
find he was so dangerous a person: I see nothing
in him but what was so exceeding harmless,
<span class="pgnm" id="page_225"></span>
that he might have lived to the end of the play,
and died in his bed, without offence to any man.</p>

<p>Fletcher's Don John is our only bugbear; and yet
I may affirm, without suspicion of flattery, that he
now speaks better, and that his character is maintained
with much more vigour in the fourth and
fifth acts, than it was by Fletcher in the three
former. I have always acknowledged the wit of
our predecessors, with all the veneration which becomes
me; but, I am sure, their wit was not that of
gentlemen; there was ever somewhat that was ill-bred
and clownish in it, and which confessed the
conversation of the authors.</p>

<p>And this leads me to the last and greatest advantage
of our writing, which proceeds from conversation.
In the age wherein those poets lived,
there was less of gallantry than in ours; neither did
they keep the best company of theirs. Their fortune
has been much like that of Epicurus, in the
retirement of his gardens; to live almost unknown,
and to be celebrated after their decease. I cannot
find that any of them had been conversant in
courts, except Ben Jonson; and his genius lay not
so much that way, as to make an improvement by
it. Greatness was not then so easy of access, nor
conversation so free, as now it is. I cannot, therefore,
conceive it any insolence to affirm, that, by
the knowledge and pattern of their wit who writ
before us, and by the advantage of our own conversation,
the discourse and raillery of our comedies
excel what has been written by them. And this
will be denied by none, but some few old fellows
who value themselves on their acquaintance with the
Black Friars; who, because they saw their plays,
would pretend a right to judge ours. The memory
of these grave gentlemen is their only plea for being
wits. They can tell a story of Ben Jonson,
<span class="pgnm" id="page_226"></span>
and, perhaps, have had fancy enough to give a supper
in the Apollo, that they might be called his
sons<a class="ftnt" href="#Almanz_6-5">[5]</a>: And, because they were drawn in to be
laughed at in those times, they think themselves
now sufficiently entitled to laugh at ours. Learning
I never saw in any of them; and wit no more
than they could remember. In short, they were
unlucky to have been bred in an unpolished age,
and more unlucky to live to a refined one. They
have lasted beyond their own, and are cast behind
ours; and, not contented to have known little at
the age of twenty, they boast of their ignorance at
threescore.</p>

<p>Now, if they ask me, whence it is that our conversation
is so much refined? I must freely, and without
flattery, ascribe it to the court; and, in it, particularly
to the king, whose example gives a law to it.
His own misfortunes, and the nation's, afforded him
an opportunity, which is rarely allowed to sovereign
princes, I mean of travelling, and being conversant
in the most polished courts of Europe; and, thereby,
of cultivating a spirit which was formed by
nature to receive the impressions of a gallant and
generous education. At his return, he found a nation
lost as much in barbarism as in rebellion: And,
as the excellency of his nature forgave the one, so
the excellency of his manners reformed the other.
<span class="pgnm" id="page_227"></span>
The desire of imitating so great a pattern first
awakened the dull and heavy spirits of the English
from their natural reservedness; loosened them
from their stiff forms of conversation, and made
them easy and pliant to each other in discourse.
Thus, insensibly, our way of living became more
free; and the fire of the English wit, which was
before stifled under a constrained, melancholy way
of breeding, began first to display its force, by mixing
the solidity of our nation with the air and
gaiety of our neighbours<a class="ftnt" href="#Almanz_6-6">[6]</a>. This being granted to
be true, it would be a wonder if the poets, whose
work is imitation, should be the only persons in
three kingdoms who should not receive advantage
by it; or, if they should not more easily imitate
the wit and conversation of the present age than of
the past.</p>

<p>Let us therefore admire the beauties and the
heights of Shakespeare, without falling after him into
a carelessness, and, as I may call it, a lethargy
of thought, for whole scenes together. Let us imitate,
as we are able, the quickness and easiness of
Fletcher, without proposing him as a pattern to us,
either in the redundancy of his matter, or the incorrectness
of his language. Let us admire his wit
and sharpness of conceit; but let us at the same
time acknowledge, that it was seldom so fixed, and
made proper to his character, as that the same
things might not be spoken by any person in the
play. Let us applaud his scenes of love; but let
<span class="pgnm" id="page_228"></span>
us confess, that he understood not either greatness
or perfect honour in the parts of any of his women.
In fine, let us allow, that he had so much fancy, as
when he pleased he could write wit; but that he
wanted so much judgment, as seldom to have written
humour, or described a pleasant folly. Let us
ascribe to Jonson, the height and accuracy of judgment
in the ordering of his plots, his choice of characters,
and maintaining what he had chosen to the
end: But let us not think him a perfect pattern of
imitation, except it be in humour; for love, which
is the foundation of all comedies in other languages,
is scarcely mentioned in any of his plays: And
for humour itself, the poets of this age will be more
wary than to imitate the meanness of his persons.
Gentlemen will now be entertained with the follies
of each other; and, though they allow Cobb and
Tib to speak properly, yet they are not much pleased
with their tankard, or with their rags: And
surely their conversation can be no jest to them on
the theatre, when they would avoid it in the street.</p>

<p>To conclude all, let us render to our predecessors
what is their due, without confining ourselves to a
servile imitation of all they writ; and, without assuming
to ourselves the title of better poets, let us
ascribe to the gallantry and civility of our age the
advantage which we have above them, and, to our
knowledge of the customs and manners of it, the
happiness we have to please beyond them.</p>

The bold Epilogue, which is here defended with so much animation,
and the censure which it threw on the fathers of the stage,
seems to have given great offence. It is thus severely assailed
by Rochester:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>But does not Dryden find even Jonson dull?</p>
<p>Beaumont and Fletcher incorrect, and full</p>
<p>Of lewd lines, as he calls them? Shakespeare's style</p>

<p>Allowing all the justice that his pride</p>
<p>So arrogantly had to these denied:</p>
<p>And may I not have leave impartially</p>
<p>To search and censure Dryden's works, and try</p>
<p>If those gross faults, his choice pen doth commit,</p>
<p>Proceed from want of judgment, or of wit?</p>
<p>Or if his lumpish fancy doth refuse</p>
<p>Spirit and grace to his loose slattern muse?</p>
<p>Five hundred verses, every morning writ,</p>
<p>Prove him no more a poet than a wit.</p>
</div>

<p>It is a bold, perhaps a presumptuous task, to attempt to separate
the true from the false criticism in the foregoing essay; for who is
qualified to be umpire betwixt Shakespeare and Dryden? Nevertheless,
our knowledge of the manners of the respective ages which
these extraordinary men adorned, and the remoteness of our own
from both, may enable us, with impartiality at least, to sift the
grounds of Dryden's censure. The nature of the stage in the days of
Shakespeare has been ascertained, by the sedulous exertions of his
commentators. A variety of small theatres, all of them accessible
to the lowest of the people, poor and rude in all the arts of decoration,
were dispersed through London when Shakespeare and Jonson
wrote for the stage. It was a natural consequence, that the
writings of these great men were biassed by the taste of those, for
whom they wrote;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>For those, who live to please, must please, to live.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">Art was not demanded; and when used by Jonson, he complains
it was not duly appreciated. Men of a middle rank were then
probably worse educated than our mere vulgar. But the good
old time bore rough and manly spirits, who came prepared with a
tribute of tears and laughter, to bursts of pathos, or effusions of
<span class="pgnm" id="page_230"></span>
humour, although incapable of receiving the delights which a cultivated
mind derives from the gradual developement of a story, the
just dependence of its parts upon each other, the minute beauties
of language, and the absence of every thing incongruous or indecorous.
Dryden, on the other hand, wrote for a stage patronized
by a monarch and his courtiers, who were professed judges of dramatic
composition; while the rigour of religious prejudice, and
perhaps a just abhorrence of the licentious turn of the drama,
banished from the theatres a great proportion of the middle classes,
always the most valuable part of an audience; because, with a
certain degree of cultivation, they unite an unhacknied energy of
feeling. Art, therefore, became, in the days of Dryden, not only
a requisite qualification, but even the principal attribute of the
dramatic poet. He was to address himself to the heads and judgments
of his audience, on the acuteness of which they piqued
themselves; not to their feelings, stupified, probably, by selfish
dissipation. Even the acquisition and exercise of critical knowledge
tends to blunt the sense of natural beauties, as a refined
harmonist becomes indifferent to the strains of simple melody.
Hence the sacrifices which Shakespeare made, without being aware,
to the taste of his age, were amply compensated by his being called
upon, and, as it were, compelled, by the nature of his audience,
to rouse them with his thunder, and to melt them with his dew.
I question much if the age of Charles II. would have borne the
introduction of Othello or Falstaff. We may find something like
Dryden's self-complacent opinion expressed by the editor of Corneille,
where he civilly admits, "<i>Corneille etoit inegal comme
Shakespeare, et plein de genie comme lui: mais le genie de Corneille
etoit a celui de Shakespeare ce qu' un seigneur est a l'egard
d'un homme de peuple, n&eacute; avec le meme esprit que lui.</i>" In other
words, the works of the one retain the rough, bold tints of nature
and originality, while those of the other are qualified by the artificial
restraints which fashion imposes upon the <i>homme de condition</i>.
It is, therefore, unjustly, that Dryden dwells so long
on Shakespeare's irregularities, amongst which I cannot help suspecting
he includes some of his greatest beauties. While we do
not defend his quibbles and carwitchets, as Bibber would have
termed them, we may rejoice that he purchased, at so slight a
sacrifice, the power and privilege of launching into every subject
with a liberty as unbounded as his genius;</p>

<p>Marriage a-la-mode was one of Dryden's most successful
comedies. A venerable praiser of the past time, in a curious
letter printed in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1745, gives us
this account of its first representation. "This comedy, acted by
his Majesty's servants at the Theatre-Royal, made its first appearance
with extraordinary lustre. Divesting myself of the old man,
I solemnly declare, that you have seen no such acting, no, not in
any degree since. The players were then, 1673, on a court establishment,
seventeen men, and eight women." <i>Gent. Mag.</i> Vol.
xv. p. 99. From a copy of verses, to which this letter is annexed,
we learn the excellence of the various performers by whom the
piece was first presented. They are addressed to a young actress.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Henceforth, in livelier characters excel,</p>
<p>Though 'tis great merit to act folly well;</p>
<p>Take, take from Dryden's hand Melantha's part,</p>
<p>The gaudy effort of luxuriant art,</p>
<p>In all imagination's glitter drest;</p>
<p>What from her lips fantastic Montfort caught,</p>
<p>And almost moved the thing the poet thought.</p>

<p>Even he, before whose visionary eyes,</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs Monfort, who, by her second marriage, became Mrs Verbruggen,
was the first who appeared in the highly popular part of
Melantha, and the action and character appear to have been held
incomparable by that unquestionable judge of the humour of a
coquette, or coxcomb, the illustrious Colley Cibber. "Melantha"
says Cibber, "is as finished an impertinent as ever fluttered
in a drawing-room; and seems to contain the most complete system
of female foppery that could possibly be crowded into the tortured
form of a fine lady. Her language, dress, motion, manners,
<span class="pgnm" id="page_234"></span>
soul, and body, are in a continual hurry to be something more
than is necessary or commendable. And, though I doubt it will be
a vain labour to offer you a just likeness of Mrs Monfort's action,
yet the fantastic expression is still so strong in my memory, that I
cannot help saying something, though fantastically, about it. The
first ridiculous airs, that break from her, are upon a gallant never
seen before, who delivers her a letter from her father, recommending
him to her good graces as an honourable lover. Here, now,
one would think she might naturally shew a little of the sex's decent
reserve, though never so slightly covered. No, sir, not a tittle
of it: Modesty is a poor-souled country gentlewoman; she is
too much a court lady to be under so vulgar a confusion. She
reads the letter, therefore, with a careless dropping lip, and an
erected brow, humming it hastily over, as if she were impatient to
outgo her father's commands, by making a complete conquest of
him at once; and, that the letter might not embarrass the attack,
crack! she crumbles it at once into her palm, and pours down upon
him her whole artillery of airs, eyes, and motion; down goes
her dainty diving body to the ground, as it she were sinking under
the conscious load of her own attractions; then launches into a
flood of fine language and compliment, still playing her chest forward
in fifty falls and risings, like a swan upon waving water;
and, to complete her impertinence, she is so rapidly fond of her own
wit, that she will not give her lover leave to praise it. Silent assenting
bows, and vain endeavours to speak, are all the share of
the conversation he is admitted to, which, at last, he is removed
from by her engagement to half a score of visits, which she swims
from him to make, with a promise to return in a twinkling." <i>Cibber's
Apology</i>, p. 99.</p>

<p>By this lively sketch, some judgment may be formed of the effect
produced by the character of Melantha, when ably represented;
but, to say the truth, we could hardly have drawn the same
deduction from a simple perusal of the piece. Of the French
phrases, which the affected lady throws into her conversation,
some have been since naturalized, as <i>good graces</i>, <i>minuet</i>, <i>chagrin</i>,
<i>grimace</i>, <i>ridicule</i>, and others. Little can be said of the tragic
part of the drama. The sudden turn of fortune in the conclusion
is ridiculed in "The Rehearsal."</p>

<p>The researches of Mr Malone have ascertained that "Marriage
A-la-Mode" was first acted in 1673, in an old theatre in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, occupied by the King's company, after that in
Drury-Lane had been burned, and during its re-building. The
play was printed in the same year.</p>

<h3 class="chap">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
THE EARL OF ROCHESTER<a class="ftnt" href="#Marr_1-1">[1]</a>.</h3>

<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I humbly dedicate to your Lordship that poem,
of which you were pleased to appear an early patron,
before it was acted on the stage. I may yet
go farther, with your permission, and say, that it
<span class="pgnm" id="page_236"></span>
received amendment from your noble hands ere it
was fit to be presented. You may please likewise
to remember, with how much favour to the author,
and indulgence to the play, you commended it to
the view of his Majesty, then at Windsor, and, by
his approbation of it in writing, made way for its
kind reception on the theatre. In this dedication,
therefore, I may seem to imitate a custom of the
ancients, who offered to their gods the firstlings of
the flock, (which, I think, they called <i>Ver sacrum</i>)
because they helped them to increase. I am sure,
if there be any thing in this play, wherein I have
raised myself beyond the ordinary lowness of my
comedies, I ought wholly to acknowledge it to the
favour of being admitted into your lordship's conversation.
And not only I, who pretend not to this
way, but the best comic writers of our age, will join
with me to acknowledge, that they have copied the
<span class="pgnm" id="page_237"></span>
gallantries of courts, the delicacy of expression, and
the decencies of behaviour, from your lordship, with
more success, than if they had taken their models from
the court of France. But this, my lord, will be no
wonder to the world, which knows the excellency
of your natural parts, and those you have acquired
in a noble education. That which, with more reason,
I admire, is that being so absolute a courtier,
you have not forgot either the ties of friendship, or
the practice of generosity. In my little experience
of a court, (which, I confess, I desire not to improve)
I have found in it much of interest, and more of
detraction: Few men there have that assurance of
a friend, as not to be made ridiculous by him when
they are absent. There are a middling sort of courtiers,
who become happy by their want of wit; but
they supply that want by an excess of malice to
those who have it. And there is no such persecution
as that of fools: They can never be considerable
enough to be talked of themselves; so that they
are safe only in their obscurity, and grow mischievous
to witty men, by the great diligence of their envy,
and by being always present to represent and aggravate
their faults. In the mean time, they are forced,
when they endeavour to be pleasant, to live on the
offals of their wit whom they decry; and either to
quote it, (which they do unwillingly) or to pass it
upon others for their own. These are the men who
make it their business to chace wit from the knowledge
of princes, lest it should disgrace their ignorance.
And this kind of malice your lordship has
not so much avoided, as surmounted. But if by the
excellent temper of a royal master, always more
ready to hear good than ill; if by his inclination to
love you; if by your own merit and address; if by
the charms of your conversation, the grace of your
behaviour, your knowledge of greatness, and habitude
<span class="pgnm" id="page_238"></span>
in courts, you have been able to preserve yourself
with honour in the midst of so dangerous a
course; yet at least the remembrance of those hazards
has inspired you with pity for other men, who,
being of an inferior wit and quality to you, are yet
persecuted, for being that in little, which your
lordship is in great<a class="ftnt" href="#Marr_1-2">[2]</a>. For the quarrel of those
people extends itself to any thing of sense; and if
I may be so vain to own it, amongst the rest of the
poets, has sometimes reached to the very borders of
it, even to me. So that, if our general good fortune
had not raised up your lordship to defend us, I
know not whether any thing had been more ridiculous
in court than writers. It is to your lordship's
favour we generally owe our protection and patronage;
and to the nobleness of your nature, which
will not suffer the least shadow of your wit to be
contemned in other men. You have been often
pleased, not only to excuse my imperfections, but
to vindicate what was tolerable in my writings from
their censures; and, what I never can forget, you
have not only been careful of my reputation, but of
my fortune. You have been solicitous to supply
my neglect of myself; and to overcome the fatal
<span class="pgnm" id="page_239"></span>
modesty of poets, which submits them to perpetual
wants, rather than to become importunate with
those people who have the liberality of kings in
their disposing, and who, dishonouring the bounty
of their master, suffer such to be in necessity who
endeavour at least to please him; and for whose
entertainment he has generously provided, if the
fruits of his royal favour were not often stopped in
other hands. But your lordship has given me occasion,
not to complain of courts whilst you are
there. I have found the effects of your mediation
in all my concernments; and they were so much
the more noble in you, because they were wholly
voluntary. I, became your lordship's, (if I may venture
on the similitude) as the world was made, without
knowing him who made it; and brought only
a passive obedience to be your creature. This nobleness
of yours I think myself the rather obliged
to own, because otherwise it must have been lost to
all remembrance: For you are endowed with that
excellent quality of a frank nature, to forget the
good which you have done.</p>

<p>But, my lord, I ought to have considered, that
you are as great a judge, as you are a patron; and
that in praising you ill, I should incur a higher note
of ingratitude, than that I thought to have avoided.
I stand in need of all your accustomed goodness for
the dedication of this play; which, though perhaps
it be the best of my comedies, is yet so faulty, that
I should have feared you for my critic, if I had not,
with some policy, given you the trouble of being
my protector. Wit seems to have lodged itself more
nobly in this age, than in any of the former; and
people of my mean condition are only writers, because
some of the nobility, and your lordship in the
first place, are above the narrow praises which poesy
<span class="pgnm" id="page_240"></span>
could give you. But, let those who love to see themselves
exceeded, encourage your lordship in so dangerous
a quality; for my own part, I must confess,
that I have so much of self-interest, as to be content
with reading some papers of your verses, without
desiring you should proceed to a scene, or play;
with the common prudence of those who are worsted
in a duel, and declare they are satisfied, when
they are first wounded. Your lordship has but
another step to make, and from the patron of wit,
you may become its tyrant; and oppress our little
reputations with more ease than you now protect
them. But these, my lord, are designs, which I
am sure you harbour not, any more than the French
king is contriving the conquest of the Swissers. It
is a barren triumph, which is not worth your pains;
and would only rank him amongst your slaves, who
is already,</p>

<p class="sig i1 smcap">My Lord,</p>
<p class="sig i2">Your Lordship's most obedient,</p>
<p class="sig i3">And most faithful servant,</p>
<p class="sig i4 smcap">John Dryden.</p>

<div class="ftnt">
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<ol>
<li><a name="Marr_1-1" id="Marr_1-1"></a>The patron, whom Dryden here addresses, was the famous
John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, the wittiest, perhaps, and most
dissolute, among the witty and dissolute courtiers of Charles II.
It is somewhat remarkable, and may be considered as a just judgment
upon the poet, that he was, a few years afterwards, way-laid
and severely beaten by bravoes, whom Lord Rochester employed
to revenge the share which Dryden is supposed to have had in the
Essay on Satire. The reader is referred to the life of the author
for the particulars of this occurrence, which is here recalled to his
recollection, as a striking illustration of the inutility, as well as
meanness, of ill applied praise; since even the eulogy of Dryden,
however liberally bestowed and beautifully expressed, failed to save
him from the most unmanly treatment at the hands of the worthless
and heartless object, on whom it was wasted. It is melancholy
to see Dryden, as may be fairly inferred from his motto, piqueing
himself on being admitted into the society of such men as Rochester,
and enjoying their precarious favour. Mr Malone has remarked,
that even in the course of the year 1673, when this dedication
came forth, Rochester entertained the perverse ambition of directing
the public favour, not according to merit, but to his own caprice.
Accordingly, he countenanced Settle in his impudent rivalry
of Dryden, and wrote a prologue to the "Empress of Morocco,"
when it was exhibited at Whitehall. Perhaps, joined to a
certain envy of Dryden's talents, the poet's intimacy with Sheffield
Earl of Mulgrave gave offence to Rochester. It is certain they
were never afterwards reconciled; and even after Rochester's death,
Dryden only mentions his once valued patron, as "a man of quality
whose ashes he will not disturb."&mdash;<i>Essay on the Origin and Progress
of Satire</i>, prefixed to Juvenal. It would seem, however,
that this dedication was very favourably received by Rochester,
since a letter of Dryden's to that nobleman is still extant, in which
he acknowledges a flattering return of compliment from his Lordship
in exchange for it.</li>
<li><a name="Marr_1-2" id="Marr_1-2"></a>When this play was acted for the first time in 1673. But
about 1675, Rochester contrived to give such offence as even
the excellent temper of his royal master was unable to digest. This
was by writing a lampoon called "The Insipids," in which the
person and character of Charles are treated with most merciless
and irreverent severity. It begins thus:

<p>Lord, how reformed and quiet are we grown,</p>
<p>Since all our braves and all our wits are gone!</p>
<p>Fop-corner now is free from civil war,</p>
<p>White-wig and vizard make no longer jar.</p>
<p>France, and the fleet, have swept the town so clear,</p>
<p>That we can act in peace, and you can hear.</p>
<p>'Twas a sad sight, before they marched from home,</p>
<p>To see our warriors in red waistcoats come,</p>
<p>With hair tucked up, into our tireing-room.</p>
<p>But 'twas more sad to hear their last adieu:</p>
<p>The women sobbed, and swore they would be true;</p>
<p>And so they were, as long as e'er they could,</p>
<p>But powerful guinea cannot be withstood,</p>
<p>And they were made of play-house flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Fate did their friends for double use ordain;</p>
<p>In wars abroad they grinning honour gain,</p>
<p>And mistresses, for all that stay, maintain.</p>
<p>Now they are gone, 'tis dead vacation here,</p>
<p>For neither friends nor enemies appear.</p>
<p>Poor pensive punk now peeps ere plays begin,</p>
<p>Sees the bare bench, and dares not venture in;</p>
<p>But manages her last half-crown with care,</p>
<p>And trudges to the Mall, on foot, for air.</p>
<p>Our city friends so far will hardly come,</p>
<p>They can take up with pleasures nearer home;</p>
<p>And see gay shows, and gaudy scenes elsewhere;</p>
<p>For we presume they seldom come to hear.</p>
<p>But they have now ta'en up a glorious trade,</p>
<p>And cutting Morecraft<a class="ftnt" href="#Marr_2-1">[1]</a> struts in masquerade.</p>

<p>A masking ball, to recommend our play;</p>
<p>Nay, to endear them more, and let them see</p>
<p>We scorn to come behind in courtesy,</p>
<p>We'll follow the new mode which they begin,</p>
<p>And treat them with a room, and couch within:</p>
<p>For that's one way, howe'er the play fall short,</p>
<p>To oblige the town, the city, and the court.</p>

<p>Footnote:</p>
<ol>
<li><a name="Marr_2-1" id="Marr_2-1"></a>In the conclusion of Beaumont and Fletcher's play of "The Scornful
Lady," Morecraft, an usurer, turns a cutter, or, as we now say, a buck.
Dryden seems to allude to Ravenscroft's play of "The Citizen turned Gentleman,"
a transmigration somewhat resembling that of cutting Morecraft.
This play was now acting by the Duke's company in Dorset Gardens, which,
from its situation, says Mr Malone, was much frequented by citizens, as here
insinuated.</li>

myself so, after five years absence from the court:
but you have freed me from one error.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> What's that, I beseech you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> I thought good voices, and ill faces, had
been inseparable; and that to be fair, and sing well,
had been only the privilege of angels.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> And how many more of these fine things
can you say to me?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Very few, madam; for if I should continue
to see you some hours longer, you look so killingly
that I should be mute with wonder.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> This will not give you the reputation of a
wit with me. You travelling monsieurs live upon
the stock you have got abroad, for the first day or
two: to repeat with a good memory, and apply
with a good grace, is all your wit; and, commonly,
your gullets are sewed up, like cormorants. When
you have regorged what you have taken in, you are
the leanest things in nature.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Then, madam, I think you had best make
that use of me; let me wait on you for two or three
days together, and you shall hear all I have learnt
of extraordinary in other countries; and one thing
<span class="pgnm" id="page_247"></span>
which I never saw 'till I came home, that is, a lady
of a better voice, better face, and better wit, than
any I have seen abroad. And, after this, if I should
not declare myself most passionately in love with
you, I should have less wit than yet you think I
have.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> A very plain, and pithy declaration. I see,
sir, you have been travelling in Spain or Italy, or
some of the hot countries, where men come to the
point immediately. But are you sure these are not
words of course? For I would not give my poor
heart an occasion of complaint against me, that I
engaged it too rashly, and then could not bring it
off.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Your heart may trust itself with me safely;
I shall use it very civilly while it stays, and
never turn it away, without fair warning to provide
for itself.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> First, then, I do receive your passion with
as little consideration, on my part, as ever you gave
it me, on yours. And now, see what a miserable
wretch you have made yourself!</p>

Give me love enough, and life enough, and I defy
Fortune.</p>

know, to thy utter confusion, that I am virtuous.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Such another word, and I give up the
ghost.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Then, to strike you quite dead, know that
I am married too.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Art thou married? O thou damnable virtuous
woman!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Yes, married to a gentleman; young, handsome
rich, valiant, and with all the good qualities
that will make you despair, and hang yourself.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Well, in spite of all that, I'll love you: Fortune
<span class="pgnm" id="page_248"></span>
has cut us out for one another; for I am to be
married within these three days; married, past redemption
to a young, fair, rich, and virtuous lady;
and it shall go hard but I will love my wife as little,
as, I perceive, you do your husband.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Remember, I invade no propriety: my servant
you are, only 'till you are married.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Both together, as you see, have prevailed

eternally; and, which is more, we never quarrel
about it, for I do the same.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> You're very unfortunate indeed: then the
case is plain, she is not handsome.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> A great beauty too, as people say.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> As people say? why, you should know that
best yourself.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Ask those, who have smelt to a strong perfume
two years together, what's the scent.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> But here are good qualities enough for one
woman.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Ay, too many, Palamede. If I could put
them into three or four women, I should be content.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> O, now I have found it! you dislike her
for no other reason but because she's your wife.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> And is not that enough? All that I know
of her perfections now, is only by memory. I remember
indeed, that about two years ago I loved
her passionately; but those golden days are gone,
Palamede: Yet I loved her a whole half year, double
the natural term of any mistress; and I think, in
my conscience, I could have held out another quarter,
but then the world began to laugh at me, and
a certain shame, of being out of fashion, seized me.
At last, we arrived at that point, that there was nothing
left in us to make us new to one another.
Yet still I set a good face upon the matter, and am
infinite fond of her before company; but when we
are alone, we walk like lions in a room; she one
way, and I another. And we lie with our backs to
each other, so far distant, as if the fashion of great
beds was only invented to keep husband and wife
sufficiently asunder.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> The truth is, your disease is very desperate;
but, though you cannot be cured you may be patched
up a little: you must get you a mistress, Rhodophil.
<span class="pgnm" id="page_251"></span>
That, indeed, is living upon cordials; but,
as fast as one fails, you must supply it with another.
You're like a gamester who has lost his estate; yet,
in doing that, you have learned the advantages of
play, and can arrive to live upon't.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Truth is, I have been thinking on't, and
have just resolved to take your counsel; and, faith,
considering the damned disadvantages of a married
man, I have provided well enough, for a poor humble
sinner, that is not ambitious of great matters.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> What is she, for a woman?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> One of the stars of Syracuse, I assure you:
Young enough, fair enough; and, but for one quality,
just such a woman as I could wish.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> O friend, this is not an age to be critical
in beauty. When we had good store of handsome
women, and but few chapmen, you might have been
more curious in your choice; but now the price is
enhanced upon us, and all mankind set up for mistresses,
so that poor little creatures, without beauty,
birth, or breeding, but only impudence, go off at
unreasonable rates: And a man, in these hard times,
snaps at them, as he does at broad gold; never examines
the weight, but takes light or heavy, as he
can get it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> But my mistress has one fault, that's almost
unpardonable; for, being a town-lady, without any
relation to the court, yet she thinks herself undone
if she be not seen there three or four times a day
with the princess Amalthea. And, for the king,
she haunts and watches him so narrowly in a morning,
that she prevents even the chemists, who beset
his chamber, to turn their mercury into his gold.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Yet, hitherto, methinks, you are no very
unhappy man.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> With all this, she's the greatest gossip in
nature; for, besides the court, she's the most eternal
<span class="pgnm" id="page_252"></span>
visitor of the town; and yet manages her time so
well, that she seems ubiquitary. For my part, I
can compare her to nothing but the sun; for, like
him, she takes no rest, nor ever sets in one place,
but to rise in another.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> I confess, she had need be handsome, with
these qualities.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> No lady can be so curious of a new fashion,
as she is of a new French word: she's the very mint
of the nation; and as fast as any bullion comes out
of France, coins it immediately into our language.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> And her name is&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> No naming; that's not like a cavalier: Find
her, if you can, by my description; and I am not
so ill a painter that I need write the name beneath
the picture.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Well, then, how far have you proceeded in
your love?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> 'Tis yet in the bud, and what fruit it may
bear I cannot tell; for this insufferable humour, of
haunting the court, is so predominant, that she has
hitherto broken all her assignations with me, for
fear of missing her visits there.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> That's the hardest part of your adventure.
But, for aught I see, fortune has used us both alike:
I have a strange kind of mistress too in court, besides
her I am to marry.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> You have made haste to be in love, then;
for, if I am not mistaken, you are but this day arrived.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> That's all one: I have seen the lady already,
who has charmed me; seen her in these
walks, courted her, and received, for the first time,
an answer that does not put me into despair.</p>

<p class="sdn">To them <span class="cnm">Argaleon, Amalthea,</span> and <span class="cnm">Artemis.</span></p>

<p class="dlg">I'll tell you more at leisure my adventures. The
<span class="pgnm" id="page_253"></span>
walks fill apace, I see. Stay, is not that the young
lord Argaleon, the king's favourite?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Yes, and as proud as ever, as ambitious, and
as revengeful.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> How keeps he the king's favour with these
qualities?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Argaleon's father helped him to the crown:
besides, he gilds over all his vices to the king, and,
standing in the dark to him, sees all his inclinations,
interests, and humours, which he so times and
soothes, that, in effect, he reigns.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> His sister Amalthea, who, I guess, stands
by him, seems not to be of his temper.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> O, she's all goodness and generosity.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arga.</span> Rhodophil, the king expects you earnestly.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> 'Tis done, my lord, what he commanded: I
only waited his return from hunting. Shall I attend
your lordship to him?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arga.</span> No; I go first another way. <span class="sdr">[Exit hastily.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> He seems in haste, and discomposed.</p>

friend? then he must needs be of much merit.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> When he has kissed the king's hand, I
know he'll beg the honour to kiss yours. Come,
Palamede.<br />
<span class="sdr">[Exeunt <span class="cnm">Rhodo.</span> and <span class="cnm">Pala.</span> bowing to
<span class="cnm">Amal.</span></span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> Madam, you tell me most surprising news.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amal.</span> The fear of it, you see,<br />
Has discomposed my brother; but to me,<br />
All, that can bring my country good, is welcome.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> It seems incredible, that this old king,<br />
Whom all the world thought childless,<br />
Should come to search the farthest parts of Sicily,<br />
In hope to find an heir.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amal.</span> To lessen your astonishment, I will<br />
<span class="pgnm" id="page_254"></span>
Unfold some private passages of state,<br />
Of which you are yet ignorant: Know, first,<br />
That this Polydamus, who reigns, unjustly<br />
Gained the crown.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> Somewhat of this I have confusedly heard.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amal.</span> I'll tell you all in brief: Theagenes,<br />
Our last great king,<br />
Had, by his queen, one only son, an infant<br />
Of three years old, called, after him, Theagenes.<br />
The general, this Polydamus, then married;<br />
The public feasts for which were scarcely past,<br />
When a rebellion in the heart of Sicily<br />
Called out the king to arms.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> Polydamus<br />
Had then a just excuse to stay behind.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amal.</span> His temper was too warlike to accept it.<br />
He left his bride, and the new joys of marriage,<br />
And followed to the field. In short, they fought,<br />
The rebels were o'ercome; but in the fight<br />
The too bold king received a mortal wound.<br />
When he perceived his end approaching near,<br />
He called the general, to whose care he left<br />
His widow queen, and orphan son; then died.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> Then false Polydamus betrayed his trust?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amal.</span> He did; and, with my father's help,&mdash;for which<br />
Heaven pardon him!&mdash;so gained their soldiers' hearts,<br />
That, in a few days, he was saluted king:<br />
And when his crimes had impudence enough<br />
To bear the eye of day,<br />
He marched his army back to Syracuse.<br />
But see how heaven can punish wicked men,<br />
In granting their desires: The news was brought him,<br />
That day he was to enter it, that Eubulus,<br />
<span class="pgnm" id="page_255"></span>
Whom his dead master had left governor,<br />
Was fled, and with him bore away the queen,<br />
And royal orphan; but, what more amazed him,<br />
His wife, now big with child, and much detesting<br />
Her husband's practices, had willingly<br />
Accompanied their flight.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> How I admire her virtue!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amal.</span> What became<br />
Of her, and them, since that, was never known;<br />
Only, some few days since, a famous robber<br />
Was taken with some jewels of vast price,<br />
Which, when they were delivered to the king,<br />
He knew had been his wife's; with these, a letter,<br />
Much torn and sullied, but which yet he knew<br />
To be her writing.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> Sure, from hence he learned<br />
He had a son?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amal.</span> It was not left so plain:<br />
The paper only said, she died in child-bed;<br />
But when it should have mentioned son or daughter,<br />
Just there it was torn off.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> Madam, the king.</p>

<p class="sdn">To them <span class="cnm">Polydamus, Argaleon,</span> Guard and Attendants.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arga.</span> The robber, though thrice racked, confessed no more.<br />
But that he took those jewels near this place.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Poly.</span> But yet the circumstances strongly argue,<br />
That those, for whom I search, are not far off.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arga.</span> I cannot easily believe it.</p>

Command him, then, as you command yourself;<br />
He is as much a part of you, as are<br />

I lie as open to the gusts of passion,<br />

I will not force thee now; but I entreat thee,<br />

A vow, which hopes of having such a son<br />
First caused.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leon.</span> Show not my disobedience by your prayers;<br />
For I must still deny you, though I now<br />
Appear more guilty to myself than you:<br />
I have some reasons, which I cannot utter,<br />
That force my disobedience; yet I mourn<br />
To death, that the first thing, you e'er enjoined me,<br />

Something so noble in the prince's nature,<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leon.</span> How precious are the hours of love in courts!<br />
In cottages, where love has all the day,<br />

Time gives himself, and is not valued, there;<br />

There, he is lazy, unemployed, and slow;<br />
Here, he's more swift; and yet has more to do.<br />
<span class="pgnm" id="page_276"></span>
So many of his hours in public move,<br />
That few are left for privacy and love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Palm.</span> The sun, methinks, shines faint and dimly, here;<br />
Light is not half so long, nor half so clear:<br />

How all the youth did to our cottage run?<br />
While winter-winds were whistling loud without,<br />
Our cheerful hearth was circled round about:<br />
With strokes in ashes, maids their lovers drew;<br />
And still you fell to me, and I to you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leon.</span> When love did of my heart possession take,<br />
I was so young, my soul was scarce awake:<br />
I cannot tell when first I thought you fair;<br />
But sucked in love, insensibly as air.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Palm.</span> I know too well when, first my love began,<br />
When at our wake you for the chaplet ran:<br />
Then I was made the lady of the May,<br />
And, with the garland, at the goal did stay:<br />
Still, as you ran, I kept you full in view;<br />
I hoped, and wished, and ran, methought, for you.<br />
As you came near, I hastily did rise,<br />
And stretched my arm outright, that held the prize.<br />
The custom was to kiss whom I should crown;<br />
You kneeled, and in my lap your head laid down:<br />
I blushed, and blushed, and did the kiss delay;<br />
At last my subjects forced me to obey:<br />
But, when I gave the crown, and then the kiss,<br />
I scarce had breath to say, Take that,&mdash;and this.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_277"></span>
<span class="cnm">Leon.</span> I felt, the while, a pleasing kind of smart;<br />
That kiss went, tingling, to my very heart.<br />
When it was gone, the sense of it did stay;<br />
The sweetness clinged upon my lips all day,<br />
Like drops of honey, loth to fall away.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Palm.</span> Life, like a prodigal, gave all his store<br />
To my first youth, and now can give no more.<br />
You are a prince; and, in that high degree,<br />
No longer must converse with humble me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leon.</span> 'Twas to my loss the gods that title gave;<br />
A tyrant's son is doubly born a slave:<br />
He gives a crown; but, to prevent my life<br />
From being happy, loads it with a wife.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Palm.</span> Speak quickly; what have you resolved to do?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leon.</span> To keep my faith inviolate to you.<br />
He threatens me with exile, and with shame,<br />
To lose my birthright, and a prince's name;<br />
But there's a blessing which he did not mean,<br />
To send me back to love and you again.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Palm.</span> Why was not I a princess for your sake?<br />
But heaven no more such miracles can make:<br />
And, since that cannot, this must never be;<br />
You shall not lose a crown for love of me.<br />
Live happy, and a nobler choice pursue;<br />
I shall complain of fate, but not of you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leon.</span> Can you so easily without me live?<br />
Or could you take the counsel, which you give?<br />
Were you a princess, would you not be true?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Palm.</span> I would; but cannot merit it from you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leon.</span> Did you not merit, as you do, my heart,<br />
Love gives esteem, and then it gives desert.<br />
But if I basely could forget my vow,<br />
Poor helpless innocence, what would you do?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Palm.</span> In woods, and plains, where first my love began,<br />
There would I live, retired from faithless man:<br />
<span class="pgnm" id="page_278"></span>
I'd sit all day within some lonely shade,<br />
Or that close arbour which your hands have made:<br />
I'd search the groves, and every tree, to find<br />
Where you had carved our names upon the rind:<br />
Your hook, your scrip, all that was yours, I'd keep,<br />
And lay them by me when I went to sleep.<br />
Thus would I live: And maidens, when I die,<br />
Upon my hearse white true-love-knots should tie;<br />
And thus my tomb should be inscribed above,<br />
<i>Here the forsaken Virgin rests from love.</i></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leon.</span> Think not that time or fate shall e'er divide<br />
Those hearts, which love and mutual vows have tied.<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leon.</span> Till the next age of hours we meet again.<br />
Meantime, we may,<br />
When near each other we in public stand,<br />
Contrive to catch a look, or steal a hand:<br />
Fancy will every touch and glance improve;<br />
And draw the most spirituous parts of love.<br />
Our souls sit close, and silently within,<br />
And their own web from their own entrails spin;<br />
And when eyes meet far off, our sense is such,<br />
That, spider-like, we feel the tenderest touch. <span class="sdr">[Exeunt.</span></p>

stab, hang, or drown myself.<br />
<span class="sdr">[Embracing him.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Nothing but the king's business could have

my dear.<br />
<span class="sdr">[Kisses her hand.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> Why, this is love as it should be betwixt
man and wife: such another couple would bring
marriage into fashion again. But is it always thus
betwixt you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Always thus! this is nothing. I tell you,
there is not such a pair of turtles in Sicily; there is
such an eternal cooing and kissing betwixt us, that
indeed it is scandalous before civil company.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Well, if I had imagined I should have been
this fond fool, I would never have married the man
I loved: I married to be happy, and have made
myself miserable by over-loving. Nay, and now
my case is desperate; for I have been married above
these two years, and find myself every day worse
and worse in love: nothing but madness can be the
end on't.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> Doat on, to the extremity, and you are
happy.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> He deserves so infinitely much, that, the
truth is, there can be no doating in the matter; but,
to love well, I confess, is a work that pays itself:
'Tis telling gold, and, after, taking it for one's pains.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> By that I should be a very covetous person;
for I am ever pulling out my money, and putting
it into my pocket again.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Pox o'your damned whistling; you can neither

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Well, thou art the most provoking wife!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Well, thou art the dullest husband, thou
art never to be provoked.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> I was never thought dull till I married
thee; and now thou hast made an old knife of me;
thou hast whetted me so long, till I have no edge
left.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> I see you are in the husband's fashion; you
reserve all your good humours for your mistresses,
and keep your ill for your wives.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Prythee leave me to my own cogitations;
I am thinking over all my sins, to find for which of
them it was I married thee.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Whatever your sin was, mine's the punishment.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> My comfort is, thou art not immortal; and,

departure, I'm resolved I'll make one holiday more
in the almanack for thy sake.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Ay, you had need make a holiday for me,
for I am sure you have made me a martyr.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_281"></span>
<span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Then, setting my victorious foot upon thy
head, in the first hour of thy silence, (that is, the
first hour thou art dead, for I despair of it before)
I will swear by thy ghost,&mdash;an oath as terrible to
me as Styx is to the gods,&mdash;never more to be in
danger of the banes of matrimony.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> And I am resolved to marry the very same
day thou diest, if it be but to show how little I'm
concerned for thee.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Pray thee, Doralice, why do we quarrel thus
a-days? ha! this is but a kind of heathenish life,
and does not answer the ends of marriage. If I
have erred, propound what reasonable atonement
may be made before we sleep, and I will not be refractory;
but withal consider, I have been married
these three years, and be not too tyrannical.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> What should you talk of a peace a-bed,
when you can give no security for performance of
articles?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Then, since we must live together, and both
of us stand upon our terms, as to matters of dying
first, let us make ourselves as merry as we can with
our misfortunes. Why, there's the devil on't! if
thou could'st make my enjoying thee but a little
easy, or a little more unlawful, thou should'st see
what a termagant lover I would prove. I have taken
such pains to enjoy thee, Doralice, that I have
fancied thee all the fine women of the town&mdash;to
help me out: But now there's none left for me to

pretty time we women have on't, to be made widows
while we are married. Our husbands think
it reasonable to complain, that we are the same, and
<span class="pgnm" id="page_282"></span>
the same to them, when we have more reason to
complain, that they are not the same to us. Because
they cannot feed on one dish, therefore we
must be starved. 'Tis enough that they have a sufficient
ordinary provided, and a table ready spread
for them: If they cannot fall too, and eat heartily,
the fault is theirs; and 'tis pity, methinks, that the
good creature should be lost, when many a poor

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Melantha</span> and <span class="cnm">Artemis</span> to her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> Dear, my dear, pity me, I am so <i>chagrin</i> to
day, and have had the most signal affront at court!
I went this afternoon to do my devoir to princess
Amalthea, found her, conversed with her, and
helped to make her court some half an hour; after
which, she went to take the air, chose out two ladies
to go with her, that came in after me, and left
me most barbarously behind her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> You are the less to be pitied, Melantha,
because you subject yourself to these affronts, by
coming perpetually to court, where you have no
business nor employment.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> I declare, I had rather of the two be rallied
nay, <i>mal trait&eacute;e</i> at court, than be deified in the
town; for, assuredly, nothing can be so <i>ridicule</i> as
a mere town lady.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Especially at court. How I have seen them
crowd and sweat in the drawing-room on a holiday-night!
For that's their time to swarm and invade
the presence. O, how they catch at a bow, or any
little salute from a courtier, to make show of their
acquaintance! and, rather than be thought to be
quite unknown, they court'sy to one another; but
they take true pains to come near the circle, and
press and peep upon the princess, to write letters
into the country how she was dressed, while the
<span class="pgnm" id="page_283"></span>
ladies, that stand about, make their court to her
with abusing them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> These are sad truths, Melantha; and therefore
I would e'en advise you to quit the court, and
live either wholly in the town, or, if you like not
that, in the country.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> In the country! nay, that's to fall beneath
the town, for they live upon our offals here. Their
entertainment of wit is only the remembrance of
what they had when they were last in town;&mdash;they
live this year upon the last year's knowledge, as
their cattle do all night, by chewing the cud of
what they eat in the afternoon.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> And they tell, for news, such unlikely stories!
A letter from one of us is such a present to
them, that the poor souls wait for the carrier's-day
with such devotion, that they cannot sleep the
night before.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> No more than I can, the night before I am
to go a journey.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Or I, before I am to try on a new gown.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> A song, that's stale here, will be new there
a twelvemonth hence; and if a man of the town by
chance come amongst them, he's reverenced for
teaching them the tune.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> A friend of mine, who makes songs sometimes,
came lately out of the west, and vowed he
was so put out of countenance with a song of his;
for, at the first country gentleman's he visited, he
saw three tailors cross legged upon the table in the
hall, who were tearing out as loud as ever they
could sing,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>&mdash;After the pangs of a desperate lover, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p class="dlg">And that all day he heard of nothing else, but the
daughters of the house, and the maids, humming it
over in every corner, and the father whistling it.
<span class="pgnm" id="page_284"></span>
<i>Arte.</i> Indeed, I have observed of myself, that
when I am out of town but a fortnight, I am so
humble, that I would receive a letter from my tailor
or mercer for a favour.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> When I have been at grass in the summer,
and am new come up again, methinks I'm to be
turned into ridicule by all that see me; but when I
have been once or twice at court, I begin to value
myself again, and to despise my country acquaintance.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> There are places where all people may be
adored, and we ought to know ourselves so well as
to choose them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> That's very true; your little courtier's wife,
who speaks to the king but once a month, need but
go to a town lady, and there she may vapour and
cry,&mdash;"The king and I," at every word. Your
town lady, who is laughed at in the circle, takes
her coach into the city, and there she's called
Your honour, and has a banquet from the merchant's
wife, whom she laughs at for her kindness.
And, as for my finical cit, she removes but to her
country house, and there insults over the country
gentlewoman that never comes up, who treats her
with furmity and custard, and opens her dear bottle
of <i>mirabilis</i> beside, for a gill-glass of it at parting.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arte.</span> At last, I see, we shall leave Melantha
where we found her; for, by your description of the
town and country, they are become more dreadful
to her than the court, where she was affronted.
But you forget we are to wait on the princess
Amalthea. Come, Doralice.</p>

it has so much of subtilty and love in it.</p>

a heightening of the same fashion.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> No, masquerade is vizor-mask in debauch,
and I like it the better for't: for, with a vizor-mask,
we fool ourselves into courtship, for the sake of an
eye that glanced; or a hand that stole itself out of
the glove sometimes, to give us a sample of the
<span class="pgnm" id="page_305"></span>
skin: But in masquerade there is nothing to be
known, she's all <i>terra incognita</i>; and the bold discoverer
leaps ashore, and takes his lot among the
wild Indians and savages, without the vile consideration
of safety to his person, or of beauty, or
wholesomeness in his mistress.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> A very fine phrase, Beliza, to let me know

elegancies.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Tell my dear lady, that since I must be so
unhappy as not to wait on her to-night, I will lament
bitterly for her absence. 'Tis true I shall be
at court, but I will take no divertisement there;
and when I return to my solitary bed, if I am so
forgetful of my passion as to sleep, I will dream of
her; and betwixt sleep and waking, put out my
foot towards her side, for midnight consolation;
and, not finding her, I will sigh, and imagine myself
a most desolate widower.</p>

in boys' habit, to rejoice with me before she

than Palamede, only because he's to be her husband.
There's something of antipathy in the word

and a quick vigorous lover! He sets out like
a carrier's horse, plodding on, because he knows he
must, with the bells of matrimony chiming so melancholy
about his neck, in pain till he's at his journey's
end; and, despairing to get thither, he is fain
to fortify imagination with the thoughts of another

<h4 class="scn">SCENE IV.</h4>

<p class="sdn">An Eating-house. Bottles of Wine on the table.
<span class="cnm">Palamede,</span> and <span class="cnm">Doralice,</span> in Man's Habit.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] Now cannot I find in my heart to
discover myself, though I long he should know me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> I tell thee, boy, now I have seen thee safe,
I must be gone: I have no leisure to throw away
on thy raw conversation; I am a person that understands
better things, I.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Were I a woman, oh how you would admire
me! cry up every word I said, and screw your
face into a submissive smile; as I have seen a dull
gallant act wit, and counterfeit pleasantness, when
he whispers to a great person in a play-house; smile,
and look briskly, when the other answers, as if
something of extraordinary had past betwixt them,
when, heaven knows, there was nothing else but,&mdash;What
a clock does your lordship think it is? And
my lord's <i>repartee</i> is,&mdash;It is almost park-time: or, at
most,&mdash;Shall we out of the pit, and go behind the
scenes for an act or two&mdash;And yet such fine things
as these would be wit in a mistress's mouth.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Ay, boy; there dame Nature's in the case:
He, who cannot find wit in a mistress, deserves to
find nothing else, boy. But these are riddles to
thee, child, and I have not leisure to instruct thee;
I have affairs to dispatch, great affairs; I am a man
of business.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Come, you shall not go: You have no affairs
but what you may dispatch here, to my knowledge.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> I find now, thou art a boy of more understanding
than I thought thee; a very lewd wicked
<span class="pgnm" id="page_312"></span>
boy: O' my conscience, thou would'st debauch me,
and hast some evil designs upon my person.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> You are mistaken, sir; I would only have
you shew me a more lawful reason why you would
leave me, than I can why you should not, and I'll
not stay you; for I am not so young, but I understand
the necessities of flesh and blood, and the
pressing occasions of mankind, as well as you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> A very forward and understanding boy!
thou art in great danger of a page's wit, to be brisk
at fourteen, and dull at twenty. But I'll give thee
no further account; I must, and will go.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> My life on it, your mistress is not at home.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> This imp will make me very angry.&mdash;I tell
thee, young sir, she is at home, and at home for
me; and, which is more, she is a-bed for me, and
sick for me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> For you only?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Aye, for me only.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> But how do you know she's sick a-bed?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> She sent her husband word so.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> And are you such a novice in love, to believe
a wife's message to her husband?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Why, what the devil should be her meaning
else?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> It may be, to go in masquerade, as well as
you; to observe your haunts, and keep you company
without your knowledge.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Nay, I'll trust her for that: She loves me
too well, to disguise herself from me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> If I were she, I would disguise on purpose
to try your wit; and come to my servant like a riddle,&mdash;Read
me, and take me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> I could know her in any shape: My good
genius would prompt me to find out a handsome
woman: There's something that would attract me
to her without my knowledge.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_313"></span>
<span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Then you make a load-stone of your mistress?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Yes, and I carry steel about me, which has
been so often touched, that it never fails to point
to the north pole.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Yet still my mind gives me, that you have
met her disguised to-night, and have not known
her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> This is the most pragmatical conceited little
fellow, he will needs understand my business
better than myself. I tell thee, once more, thou
dost not know my mistress.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> And I tell you once more, that I know her
better than you do.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> The boy's resolved to have the last word.
I find I must go without reply. <span class="sdr">[Exit.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Ah mischief, I have lost him with my fooling.

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Now, where was your good genius, that
would prompt you to find me out?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Why, you see I was not deceived; you
yourself were my good genius.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> But where was the steel, that knew the load-stone?
Ha?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> The truth is, madam, the steel has lost its
virtue: and, therefore, if you please, we'll new
touch it.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Rhodophil;</span> and <span class="cnm">Melantha</span> in Boys habit.

quarters? What? Engaging with a boy? Is all honourable?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> O, very honourable on my side. I was
just chastising this young villain; he was running
away, without paying his share of the reckoning.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Then I find I was deceived in him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> There's no retiring now; I warrant you for
discovery. Now have I the oddest thought, to entertain
you before your servant's face, and he never

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> No more than a picture in the hangings.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Nay, then he can never discover me, now
the wrong side of the arras is turned towards him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> At least, it will be some pleasure to me, to
enjoy what freedom I can while he looks on; I will
storm the out-works of matrimony even before his

<p class="sdn"><span class="cnm">Palamede, Strato. Palamede</span> with a letter
in his hand.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> This evening, sayest thou? will they both
be here?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Stra.</span> Yes, sir, both my old master, and your mistress's
father. The old gentlemen ride hard this
journey; they say, it shall be the last time they
will see the town; and both of them are so pleased
<span class="pgnm" id="page_323"></span>
with this marriage, which they have concluded for
you, that I am afraid they will live some years longer
to trouble you, with the joy of it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> But this is such an unreasonable thing, to
impose upon me to be married to-morrow; 'tis hurrying
a man to execution, without giving him time
to say his prayers.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Stra.</span> Yet, if I might advise you, sir, you should
not delay it; for your younger brother comes up
with them, and is got already into their favours.
He has gained much upon my old master, by finding
fault with innkeepers' bills, and by starving us,
and our horses, to shew his frugality; and he is very
well with your mistress's father, by giving him recipes
for the spleen, gout and scurvy, and other infirmities
of old age.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> I'll rout him, and his country education:
Pox on him, I remember him before I travelled, he
had nothing in him but mere jockey; used to talk
loud, and make matches, and was all for the crack
of the field: Sense and wit were as much banished
from his discourse, as they are when the court goes
out of town to a horse race. Go now and provide
your master's lodgings.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Stra.</span> I go, sir. <span class="sdr">[Exit.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> It vexes me to the heart, to leave all my
designs with Doralice unfinished; to have flown
her so often to a mark, and still to be bobbed at retrieve:
If I had once enjoyed her, though I could
not have satisfied my stomach with the feast, at
least I should have relished my mouth a little; but
now&mdash;</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Philotis.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Phil.</span> Oh, sir, you are happily met; I was coming
to find you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> From your lady. I hope.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_324"></span>
<span class="cnm">Phil.</span> Partly from her; but more especially from
myself: She has just now received a letter from her
father, with an absolute command to dispose herself
to marry you to-morrow.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> And she takes it to the death?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Phil.</span> Quite contrary: The letter could never
have come in a more lucky minute; for it found
her in an ill-humour with a rival of yours, that shall
be nameless, about the pronunciation of a French
word.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Count Rhodophil? never disguise it, I
know the amour: But I hope you took the occasion
to strike in for me?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Phil.</span> It was my good fortune to do you some
small service in it; for your sake I discommended
him all over,&mdash;clothes, person, humour, behaviour,
every thing; and, to sum up all, told her, it was impossible
to find a married man that was otherwise;
for they were all so mortified at home with their
wives' ill humours, that they could never recover
themselves to be company abroad.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Most divinely urged!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Phil.</span> Then I took occasion to commend your
good qualities; as the sweetness of your humour,
the comeliness of your person, your good mein, your
valour; but, above all, your liberality.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> I vow to Gad I had like to have forgot
that good quality in myself, if thou hadst not remembered
me of it: Here are five pieces for thee.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Phil.</span> Lord, you have the softest hand, sir, it
would do a woman good to touch it: Count Rhodophil's
is not half so soft; for I remember I felt
it once, when he gave me ten pieces for my new-years-gift.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> O, I understand you, madam; you shall
find my hand as soft again as Count Rhodophil's:
<span class="pgnm" id="page_325"></span>
There are twenty pieces for you. The former was
but a retaining fee; now I hope you'll plead for
me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Phil.</span> Your own merits speak enough. Be sure
only to ply her with French words, and I'll warrant
you'll do your business. Here are a list of her
phrases for this day: Use them to her upon all occasions
and foil her at her own weapon; for she's
like one of the old Amazons, she'll never marry,
except it be the man who has first conquered her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> I'll be sure to follow your advice: But
you'll forget to further my design.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Phil.</span> What, do you think I'll be ungrateful?&mdash;But
however, if you distrust my memory, put some
token on my finger to remember it by: That diamond
there would do admirably.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> There 'tis; and I ask your pardon heartily

takes away the sense of hell and hanging from
him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> No, good Palamede, I must not be so injurious
to your bride: 'Tis ill drawing from the bank
to-day, when all your ready money is payable to-morrow.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> A wife is only to have the ripe fruit, that
falls of itself; but a wise man will always preserve
a shaking for a mistress.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> But a wife for the first quarter is a mistress.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> But when the second comes&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> When it does come, you are so given to
variety, that you would make a wife of me in another
quarter.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> No, never, except I were married to you:
married people can never oblige one another; for
all they do is duty, and consequently there can be
no thanks: But love is more frank and generous
than he is honest; he's a liberal giver, but a cursed
pay-master.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> I declare I will have no gallant; but, if I
would, he should never be a married man; a married
man is but a mistress's half-servant, as a clergyman
is but the king's half-subject: For a man to
come to me that smells of the wife! 'Slife, I would
as soon wear her old gown after her, as her husband.
<span class="pgnm" id="page_331"></span>
<i>Pala.</i> Yet 'tis a kind of fashion to wear a princess's
cast shoes; you see the country ladies buy
them, to be fine in them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Yes, a princess's shoes may be worn after
her, because they keep their fashion, by being so
very little used; but generally a married man is the
creature of the world the most out of fashion: his
behaviour is dumpish; his discourse, his wife and
family; his habit so much neglected, it looks as if
that were married too; his hat is married, his peruke
is married, his breeches are married,&mdash;and, if we
could look within his breeches, we should find him
married there too.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Am I then to be discarded for ever? pray
do but mark how that word sounds: for ever! it
has a very damn'd sound, Doralice.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Ay, for ever! it sounds as hellishly to me,
as it can do to you, but there's no help for it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Yet, if we had but once enjoyed one another!&mdash;but
then once only, is worse than not at all:
It leaves a man with such a lingering after it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> For aught I know, 'tis better that we have
not; we might upon trial have liked each other
less, as many a man and woman, that have loved
as desperately as we, and yet, when they came to
possession, have sighed and cried to themselves, Is
this all?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> That is only, if the servant were not found
a man of this world; but if, upon trial, we had
not liked each other, we had certainly left loving;
and faith, that's the greater happiness of the two.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> 'Tis better as 'tis; we have drawn off already
as much of our love as would run clear; after
possessing, the rest is but jealousies, and disquiets,
and quarrelling, and piecing.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Nay, after one great quarrel, there's never
any sound piecing; the love is apt to break in the
same place again.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_332"></span>
<span class="cnm">Dor.</span> I declare I would never renew a love;
that's like him, who trims an old coach for ten
years together; he might buy a new one better
cheap.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Well, madam, I am convinced, that 'tis
best for us not to have enjoyed; but, gad, the
strongest reason is, because I can't help it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> The only way to keep us new to one another
is never to enjoy, as they keep grapes, by
hanging them upon a line; they must touch nothing,
if you would preserve them fresh.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> But then they wither, and grow dry in the
very keeping; however, I shall have a warmth for
you, and an eagerness, every time I see you; and,
if I chance to out-live Melantha&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> And if I chance to out-live Rhodophil&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Well, I'll cherish my body as much as I
can, upon that hope. 'Tis true, I would not directly
murder the wife of my bosom; but, to kill her
civilly, by the way of kindness, I'll put as fair as
another man: I'll begin to-morrow night, and be
very wrathful with her; that's resolved on.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Well, Palamede, here's my hand, I'll venture
to be your second wife, for all your threatenings.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> In the mean time I'll watch you hourly,
as I would the ripeness of a melon; and I hope
you'll give me leave now and then to look on you,
and to see if you are not ready to be cut yet.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> No, no, that must not be, Palamede, for
fear the gardener should come and catch you taking
up the glass.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Rhodophil.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] Billing so sweetly! now I am confirmed
in my suspicions; I must put an end to this
ere it go farther&mdash;[<span class="sdm">To <span class="cnm">Doralice.</span></span>] Cry you mercy,
<span class="pgnm" id="page_333"></span>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> What recreations?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Nay, no excuses, good spouse; I saw fair
hand conveyed to lip, and prest, as though you had
been squeezing soft wax together for an indenture.
Palamede, you and I must clear this reckoning:
why would you have seduced my wife?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Why would you have debauched my mistress?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> What do you think of that civil couple, that
played at a game, called Hide and Seek, last evening
in the grotto?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> What do you think of that innocent pair,
who made it their pretence to seek for others, but
came, indeed, to hide themselves there?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> All things considered, I begin vehemently
to suspect, that the young gentleman I found in
your company last night, was a certain youth of
my acquaintance.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> And I have an odd imagination, that you
could never have suspected my small gallant, if
your little villainous Frenchman had not been a
false brother.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Further arguments are needless; draw off;
I shall speak to you now by the way of <i>bilbo</i>.<br />
<span class="sdr">[Claps his hand to his sword.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> And I shall answer you by the way of Dangerfield<a class="ftnt" href="#Marr_3-2">[2]</a>.
<span class="sdr">[Claps his hand on his.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Hold, hold; are not you two a couple of
mad fighting fools, to cut one another's throats for
nothing?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_334"></span>
<span class="cnm">Pala.</span> How for nothing? He courts the woman I
must marry.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> And he courts you, whom I have married.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> But you can neither of you be jealous of
what you love not.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Faith, I am jealous, and this makes me partly
suspect that I love you better than I thought.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Pish! a mere jealousy of honour.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Gad, I am afraid there's something else in't;
for Palamede has wit, and, if he loves you, there's
something more in ye than I have found: Some
rich mine, for aught I know, that I have not yet
discovered.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> 'Slife, what's this? Here's an argument for
me to love Melantha; for he has loved her, and he
has wit too, and, for aught I know, there may be a
mine; but, if there be, I am resolved I'll dig for it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> [<span class="sdm">To <span class="cnm">Rhodophil.</span></span>] Then I have found my
account in raising your jealousy. O! 'tis the most
delicate sharp sauce to a cloyed stomach; it will
give you a new edge, Rhodophil.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> And a new point too, Doralice, if I could
be sure thou art honest.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> If you are wise, believe me for your own
sake: Love and religion have but one thing to trust
to; that's a good sound faith. Consider, if I have
played false, you can never find it out by any experiment
you can make upon me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> No? Why, suppose I had a delicate screwed
gun; if I left her clean, and found her foul, I
should discover, to my cost, she had been shot in.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> But if you left her clean, and found her only
rusty, you would discover, to your shame, she was
only so for want of shooting.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Rhodophil, you know me too well to imagine
I speak for fear; and therefore, in consideration
<span class="pgnm" id="page_335"></span>
of our past friendship, I will tell you, and bind
it by all things holy, that Doralice is innocent.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Friend, I will believe you, and vow the
same for your Melantha; but the devil on't is, how
shall we keep them so?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> What dost think of a blessed community
betwixt us four, for the solace of the women,
and relief of the men? Methinks it would be a
pleasant kind of life: Wife and husband for the
standing dish, and mistress and gallant for the desert.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> But suppose the wife and mistress should
both long for the standing dish, how should they
be satisfied together?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> In such a case they must draw lots; and
yet that would not do neither, for they would both
be wishing for the longest cut.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> Then I think, Palamede, we had as good
make a firm league, not to invade each other's propriety.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pala.</span> Content, say I. From henceforth let all
acts of hostility cease betwixt us; and that, in the
usual form of treaties, as well by sea as land, and
in all fresh waters.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> I will add but one <i>proviso</i>, that whoever
breaks the league, either by war abroad, or neglect
at home, both the women shall revenge themselves
by the help of the other party.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Rho.</span> That's but reasonable. Come away, Doralice;
I have a great temptation to be sealing articles
in private.</p>

<p>Thus have my spouse and I informed the nation,</p>
<p>And led you all the way to reformation;</p>
<p>Not with dull morals, gravely writ, like those,</p>
<p>Which men of easy phlegm with care compose,&mdash;</p>
<p>Your poets, of stiff words and limber sense,</p>
<p>Born on the confines of indifference;</p>
<p>But by examples drawn, I dare to say,</p>
<p>From most of you who hear and see the play.</p>
<p>There are more Rhodophils in this theatre,</p>
<p>More Palamedes, and some few wives, I fear:</p>
<p>But yet too far our poet would not run;</p>
<p>Though 'twas well offered, there was nothing done.</p>
<p>He would not quite the women's frailty bare,</p>
<p>But stript them to the waist, and left them there:</p>
<p>And the men's faults are less severely shown,</p>
<p>For he considers that himself is one.&mdash;</p>
<p>Some stabbing wits, to bloody satire bent,</p>
<p>Would treat both sexes with less compliment;</p>
<p>Would lay the scene at home; of husbands tell,</p>
<p>For wenches, taking up their wives i' the Mall;</p>
<p>And a brisk bout, which each of them did want,</p>
<p>Made by mistake of mistress and gallant.</p>
<p>Our modest author thought it was enough</p>
<p>To cut you off a sample of the stuff:</p>
<p>He spared my shame, which you, I'm sure, would not,</p>
<p>For you were all for driving on the plot:</p>
<p>You sighed when I came in to break the sport,</p>
<p>And set your teeth when each design fell short.</p>
<p>To wives and servants all good wishes lend,</p>
<p>But the poor cuckold seldom finds a friend.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, court and town will take no pity,</p>

<h3 class="chap">THE ASSIGNATION.</h3>

<p>This play was unfortunate in the representation. It is needless,
at the distance of more than a century, to investigate the grounds
of the dislike of an audience, who, perhaps, could at the very time
have given no good reason for their capricious condemnation of a
play, not worse than many others which they received with applause.
The author, in the dedication, hints at the "lameness of the action;"
but, as the poet and performers are nearly equally involved
in the disgrace of a condemned piece, it is a very natural
desire on either side to assign the cause of its failure to the imperfections
of the other; of which there is a ludicrous representation
in a dialogue betwixt the player and the poet in "Joseph
Andrews." Another cause of its unfavourable reception
seems to have been, its second title of "Love in a Nunnery."
Dryden certainly could, last of any man, have been justly suspected
of an intention to ridicule the Duke of York and the Catholic
religion; yet, as he fell under the same censure for the "Spanish
Friar," it seems probable that such suspicions were actually entertained.
The play certainly contains, in the present instance, nothing
to justify them. In point of merit, "The Assignation" seems
pretty much on a level with Dryden's other comedies; and certainly
the spectators, who had received the blunders of Sir Martin
Mar-all with such unbounded applause, might have taken some
interest in those of poor Benito. Perhaps the absurd and vulgar
scene, in which the prince pretends a fit of the cholic, had some
share in occasioning the fall of the piece. This inelegant <i>jeu de
theatre</i> is severely ridiculed in the "Rehearsal."</p>

<p>To one person, the damnation of this play seems to have afforded
exquisite pleasure. This was Edward Ravenscroft, once a
member of the Middle Temple,&mdash;an ingenious gentleman, of whose
taste it may be held a satisfactory instance, that he deemed the
tragedy of "Titus Andronicus" too mild for representation, and generously
added a few more murders, rapes, and parricides, to that
charnel-house of horrors<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_1-1">[1]</a>. His turn for comedy being at least
<span class="pgnm" id="page_346"></span>
equal to his success in the blood-stained buskin, Mr Ravenscroft
translated and mangled several of the more farcical French comedies,
which he decorated with the lustre of his own great name.
Amongst others which he thus appropriated, were the most extravagant
and buffoon scenes in Moliere's "<i>Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i>;"
in which Monsieur Jourdain is, with much absurd ceremony, created
a Turkish Paladin; and where Moliere took the opportunity
to introduce an <i>entr&eacute;e de ballet</i>, danced and sung by the Mufti,
dervises, and others, in eastern habits. Ravenscroft's translation,
entitled "The Citizen turned Gentleman," was acted in 1672,
and printed in the same year; the jargon of the songs, like similar
nonsense of our own day, seems to have been well received on
the stage. Dryden, who was not always above feeling indignation
at the bad taste and unjust preferences of the age, attacked Ravenscroft
in the prologue to "The Assignation," as he had before,
though less directly, in that of "Marriage a-la-Mode." Hence
the exuberant and unrepressed joy of that miserable scribbler
broke forth upon the damnation of Dryden's performance, in
the following passage of a prologue to another of his pilfered performances,
called "The Careless Lovers," acted, according to
Langbaine, in the vacation succeeding the fall of "The Assignation,"
in 1673:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>An author did, to please you, let his wit run,</p>
<p>Of late, much on a serving man and cittern;</p>
<p>And yet, you would not like the serenade,&mdash;</p>
<p>Nay, and you damned his nuns in masquerade:</p>
<p>You did his Spanish sing-song too abhor;</p>
<p><i>Ah! que locura con tanto rigor!</i></p>
<p>In fine, the whole by you so much was blamed,</p>
<p>To act their parts, the players were ashamed<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_1-2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Ah, how severe your malice was that day!</p>
<p>To damn, at once, the poet and his play<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_1-3">[3]</a>:</p>
<p>But why was your rage just at that time shown,</p>
<p>When what the author writ was all his own?</p>
<p>Till then, he borrowed from romance, and did translate<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_1-4">[4]</a>;</p>
<p>And those plays found a more indulgent fate.</p>
</div>

<p>Ravenscroft, however, seems to have given the first offence; for,
in the prologue to "The Citizen turned Gentleman," licensed 9th
<span class="pgnm" id="page_347"></span>
August 1672, we find the following lines, obviously levelled at
"The Conquest of Granada," and other heroic dramas of our author:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Then shall the knight, that had a knock in's cradle,</p>
<p>Such as Sir Martin and Sir Arthur Addle<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_1-5">[5]</a>,</p>
<p>Be flocked unto, as the great heroes now</p>
<p>In plays of rhyme and noise, with wondrous show:&mdash;</p>
<p>Then shall the house, to see these Hectors kill and slay,</p>
<p>That bravely fight out the whole plot of the play,</p>
<p>Be for at least six months full every day.</p>
</div>

<p>Langbaine, who quotes the lines from the prologue to Ravenscroft's
"Careless Lovers," is of opinion, that he paid Dryden too
great a compliment in admitting the originality of "The Assignation,"
and labours to shew, that the characters are imitated from
the "Romance Comique" of Scarron, and other novels of the
time. But Langbaine seems to have been unable to comprehend,
that originality consists in the mode of treating a subject, more
than in the subject itself.</p>

<p>"The Assignation" was acted in 1672, and printed in 1673.</p>

off Ravenscroft's disguise, and discover the politic plagiary that lurks under
it. I know," continues the biographer, "he has endeavoured to shew himself

what he writes is <i>extempore</i> wit, and written <i>currente calamo</i>. But I doubt

<h3 class="chap">TO MY MOST HONOURED FRIEND,
SIR CHARLES SEDLEY, BART<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_2-1">[1]</a>.</h3>

<p class="smcap">Sir,</p>

<p>The design of dedicating plays is as common and
unjust, as that of desiring seconds in a duel. It is
<span class="pgnm" id="page_349"></span>
engaging our friends, it may be, in a senseless quarrel
where they have much to venture, without any
concernment of their own<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_2-2">[2]</a>. I have declared thus
much beforehand, to prevent you from suspicion, that
I intend to interest either your judgment or your
kindness, in defending the errors of this comedy. It
succeeded ill in the representation, against the opinion
of many of the best judges of our age, to whom you
know I read it, ere it was presented publicly. Whether
the fault was in the play itself, or in the lameness
of the action, or in the number of its enemies, who
came resolved to damn it for the title, I will not now
dispute. That would be too like the little satisfaction
which an unlucky gamester finds in the relation
of every cast by which he came to lose his money.
I have had formerly so much success, that the miscarriage
of this play was only my giving Fortune her
<span class="pgnm" id="page_350"></span>
revenge; I owed it her, and she was indulgent that
she exacted not the payment long before. I will
therefore deal more reasonably with you, than any
poet has ever done with any patron: I do not so
much as oblige you for my sake, to pass two ill
hours in reading of my play. Think, if you please,
that this dedication is only an occasion I have taken,
to do myself the greatest honour imaginable with
posterity; that is, to be recorded in the number of
those men whom you have favoured with your
friendship and esteem. For I am well assured, that,
besides the present satisfaction I have, it will gain
me the greatest part of my reputation with after
ages, when they shall find me valuing myself on
your kindness to me; I may have reason to suspect
my own credit with them, but I have none to doubt
of yours. And they who, perhaps, would forget me
in my poems, would remember me in this epistle.</p>

<p>This was the course which has formerly been
practised by the poets of that nation, who were
masters of the universe. Horace and Ovid, who
had little reason to distrust their immortality, yet
took occasion to speak with honour of Virgil, Varius,
Tibullus, and Propertius, their contemporaries; as
if they sought, in the testimony of their friendship,
a farther evidence of their fame. For my own part,
I, who am the least amongst the poets, have yet the
fortune to be honoured with the best patron, and
the best friend. For, (to omit some great persons
of our court, to whom I am many ways obliged,
and who have taken care of me even amidst the
exigencies of a war<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_2-3">[3]</a>) I can make my boast to have
found a better M&aelig;cenas in the person of my Lord
Treasurer Clifford<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_2-4">[4]</a>, and a more elegant Tibullus in
<span class="pgnm" id="page_351"></span>
that of Sir Charles Sedley. I have chosen that poet
to whom I would resemble you, not only because I
think him at least equal, if not superior, to Ovid in
his elegies; nor because of his quality, for he was,
you know, a Roman knight, as well as Ovid; but
for his candour, his wealth, his way of living, and
particularly because of this testimony which is given
him by Horace, which I have a thousand times in
my mind applied to you:</p>

<div class="poem" style="font-style: italic">
<p>Non tu corpus eras sine pectore: Dii tibi formam,</p>
<p>Dii tibi divitias dederant, artemque fruendi.</p>
<p>Quid voveat dulci nutricula majus alumno,</p>
<p>Quam sapere, et fari possit qu&aelig; sentiat, et cui</p>
<p>Gratia, forma, valetudo contingat abunde;</p>
<p>Et mundus victus, non deficiente crumena?</p>
</div>

<p>Certainly the poets of that age enjoyed much happiness
in the conversation and friendship of one
another. They imitated the best way of living,
which was, to pursue an innocent and inoffensive
pleasure, that which one of the ancients called
<i>eruditam voluptatem</i>. We have, like them, our genial
nights, where our discourse is neither too serious
nor too light, but always pleasant, and, for the
most part, instructive; the raillery, neither too sharp
upon the present, nor too censorious on the absent;
and the cups only such as will raise the conversation
of the night, without disturbing the business
of the morrow<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_2-5">[5]</a>. And thus far not only the philosophers,
<span class="pgnm" id="page_352"></span>
but the fathers of the church, have gone,
without lessening their reputation of good manners,
or of piety. For this reason, I have often laughed
at the ignorant and ridiculous descriptions which
some pedants have given of the wits, as they are pleased
to call them; which are a generation of men as
unknown to them, as the people of Tartary, or the
Terra Australia, are to us. And therefore as we draw
giants and anthropophagi in those vacancies of our
maps, where we have not travelled to discover better;
so those wretches paint lewdness, atheism,
folly, ill-reasoning, and all manner of extravagancies
amongst us, for want of understanding what we are.
Oftentimes it so falls out, that they have a particular
pique to some one amongst us, and then they immediately
interest heaven in their quarrel; as it is an
usual trick in courts, when one designs the ruin of
his enemy, to disguise his malice with some concernment
of the kings; and to revenge his own
cause, with pretence of vindicating the honour of
his master. Such wits as they describe, I have
never been so unfortunate as to meet in your company;
but have often heard much better reasoning
at your table, than I have encountered in their books.
<span class="pgnm" id="page_353"></span>
The wits they describe, are the fops we banish: For
blasphemy and atheism, if they were neither sin
nor ill manners, are subjects so very common, and
worn so threadbare, that people, who have sense,
avoid them, for fear of being suspected to have
none. It calls the good name of their wit in question
as it does the credit of a citizen when his shop
is filled with trumperies and painted titles, instead
of wares: We conclude them bankrupt to all manner
of understanding; and that to use blasphemy, is a
kind of applying pigeons to the soles of the feet; it
proclaims their fancy, as well as judgment, to be
in a desperate condition. I am sure, for your own
particular, if any of these judges had once the happiness
to converse with you,&mdash;to hear the candour of
your opinions; how freely you commend that wit
in others of which you have, so large a portion yourself;
how unapt you are to be censorious; with how
much easiness you speak so many things, and those
so pointed, that no other man is able to excel, or
perhaps to reach by study;&mdash;they would, instead of
your accusers, become your proselytes. They would
reverence so much sense, and so much good nature
in the same person; and come, like the satyr, to
warm themselves at that fire, of which they were
ignorantly afraid when they stood at a distance.
But you have too great a reputation to be wholly
free from censure: it is a fine which fortune sets
upon all extraordinary persons, and from which you
should not wish to be delivered until you are dead.
I have been used by my critics much more severely,
and have more reason to complain, because I am
deeper taxed for a less estate. I am, ridiculously
enough, accused to be a contemner of universities;
that is, in other words, an enemy of learning;
without the foundation of which, I am sure, no
man can pretend to be a poet. And if this be not
<span class="pgnm" id="page_354"></span>
enough, I am made a detractor from my predecessors,
whom I confess to have been my masters in
the art. But this latter was the accusation of the
best judge, and almost the best poet, in the Latin
tongue. You find Horace complaining, that, for
taxing some verses in Lucilius, he himself was
blamed by others, though his design was no other
than mine now, to improve the knowledge of
poetry; and it was no defence to him, amongst his
enemies, any more than it is for me, that he praised
Lucilius where he deserved it; <i>pagin&acirc; laudatur
e&acirc;dem</i>. It is for this reason I will be no more
mistaken for my good meaning: I know I honour
Ben Jonson more than my little critics, because,
without vanity I may own, I understand him better<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_2-6">[6]</a>.
As for the errors they pretend to find in me,
I could easily show them, that the greatest part of
them are beauties; and for the rest, I could recriminate
upon the best poets of our nation, if I could
resolve to accuse another of little faults, whom, at
the same time, I admire for greater excellencies.
But I have neither concernment enough upon me to
write any thing in my own defence, neither will I
gratify the ambition of two wretched scribblers,
who desire nothing more than to be answered. I
have not wanted friends, even among strangers,
who have defended me more strongly, than my contemptible
pedant could attack me<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_2-7">[7]</a>. For the other,
<span class="pgnm" id="page_355"></span>
he is only like Fungoso in the play, who follows the
fashion at a distance, and adores the Fastidious Brisk
of Oxford<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_2-8">[8]</a>. You can bear me witness, that I have
not consideration enough for either of them to be
angry. Let M&aelig;vius and Bavius admire each other;
I wish to be hated by them and their fellows, by
the same reason for which I desire to be loved by
you. And I leave it to the world, whether their
judgment of my poetry ought to be preferred to
yours; though they are as much prejudiced by their
malice, as I desire you should be led by your kindness,
to be partial to,</p>

<p class="i1 sig smcap">Sir,</p>
<p class="i2 sig">Your most humble,</p>
<p class="i3 sig">And most faithful servant,</p>

<ol>
<li><a name="Assig_2-1" id="Assig_2-1"></a>Sir Charles Sedley, noted among "the mob of gentlemen who
wrote with ease," was so highly applauded for his taste and
judgment, that Charles said, "Nature had given him a patent to
be Apollo's viceroy." Some account has been given of this celebrated
courtier, in the introduction to the Essay on Dramatic
Poetry. Dryden was at this time particularly induced to appeal
to the taste of the first among the gay world, by the repeated censures
which had been launched against him from the groves of
Academe. Mr Malone gives the titles of three pamphlets which
had appeared against Dryden. 1. The Censure of the Rota, on
Mr Dryden's Conquest of Granada, printed at Oxford. 2. A
Description of the Academy of the Athenian Virtuoso, with a
discourse held there in vindication of Mr Dryden's Conquest of
Granada, against the Author of the Censure of the Rota. 3. A
Friendly Vindication of Mr Dryden, from the Author of the Censure
of the Rota, printed at Cambridge. Thus assailed by the grave
and the learned, censured for the irregularities of his gay patrons,
which he countenanced although he did not partake, and stigmatized
as a detractor of his predecessors, and a defamer of classical
learning, it was natural for Dryden to appeal to the most accomplished
of those amongst whom he lived, and to whose taste he was
but too strongly compelled to adapt his productions. Sedley,
therefore, as a man of wit and gallantry, is called upon to support
our author against the censures of pedantic severity. Whatever
may be thought of the subject, the appeal is made with all
Dryden's spirit and elegance, and his description of the attic
evenings spent with Sedley and his gay associates, glosses over,
and almost justifies, their occasional irregularities. We have but
too often occasion to notice, with censure, the licentious manners
of the giddy court of Charles; let us not omit its merited commendation.
If the talents of the men of parts of that period were
often ill-directed, and ill-rewarded, let not us, from whom that
gratitude is justly due, forget that they were called forth and stimulated
to exertion, by the countenance and applause of the
great. We, at least, who enjoy the fruit of these exertions, ought
to rejoice, that the courtiers of Charles possessed the taste to countenance
and applaud the genius which was too often perverted by
the profligacy of their example, and left unrewarded amid their
selfish prodigality.</li>

<li><a name="Assig_2-5" id="Assig_2-5"></a>It is impossible to avoid contrasting this beautiful account of
elegant dissipation with the noted freak of Sir Charles Sedley, to
whom it is addressed. In June 1663, being in company with Lord
Buckhurst and Sir Thomas Ogle, in a tavern in Bowstreet, and
having become furious with intoxication, they not only exposed
themselves, by committing the grossest indecencies in the balcony,
in the sight of the passengers; but, a mob being thus collected,
Sedley stripped himself naked, and proceeded to harangue them in
the grossest and most impious language. The indignation of the
populace being excited, they attempted to burst into the house,
and a desperate riot ensued, in which the orator and his companions
had nearly paid for their frolic with their lives. For this
riot they were indicted in the Court of Common Pleas, and heavily
fined; Sedley in the sum of L. 500. When the Lord Chief Justice,
Sir Robert Hyde, to repress his insolence, asked him if he had ever
read the "Complete Gentleman?" Sedley answered, that he had
read more books than his lordship; a repartee which exhibits more
effrontery than wit. The culprits employed Killigrew and another
courtier to solicit a mitigation of the fine; but, in the true spirit
of court friendship, they begged it for themselves, and extorted
every farthing.</li>

<li><a name="Assig_2-7" id="Assig_2-7"></a>The pedant Mr Malone conjectures to be Matthew Clifford,
Master of the Charter-house, one of the Duke of Buckingham's
colleagues in writing "The Rehearsal." But the <i>pedant</i> is obviously
the same with the Fastidious Brisk <i>of Oxford</i>, mentioned in the
following sentence, which can hardly apply to Clifford, who was
educated at Cambridge. One Leigh is said by Wood to have
written the Censure of the Rota; and as he was educated at Oxford
and the book printed there, he may be "the contemptible
pedant," though his profession was that of a player in the duke's
company.</li>

<li><a name="Assig_2-8" id="Assig_2-8"></a>Fungoso and Sir Fastidious Brisk are two characters in "Every

the other.</li>

<p>But, to their cost, you proved it was their own:</p>
<p>For, when a fop's presented on the stage,</p>
<p>Straight all the coxcombs in the town engage;</p>
<p>For his deliverance and revenge they join,</p>
<p>And grunt, like hogs, about their captive swine.</p>
<p>Your poets daily split upon this shelf,&mdash;</p>
<p>You must have fools, yet none will have himself.</p>
<p>Or if, in kindness, you that leave would give,</p>
<p>No man could write you at that rate you live:</p>
<p>For some of you grow fops with so much haste,</p>
<p>Riot in nonsense, and commit such waste,</p>
<p>'Twould ruin poets should they spend so fast.</p>
<p>He, who made this, observed what farces hit,</p>
<p>And durst not disoblige you now with wit.</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, you over-do the mode;</p>
<p>You must have fools out of the common road.</p>
<p>Th' unnatural strained buffoon is only taking;</p>
<p>No fop can please you now of God's own making.</p>
<p>Pardon our poet, if he speaks his mind;</p>
<p>You come to plays with your own follies lined:</p>
<p>Small fools fall on you, like small showers, in vain;</p>
<p>Your own oiled coats keep out all common rain.</p>
<p>You must have Mamamouchi<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_3-1">[1]</a>, such a fop</p>
<p>As would appear a monster in a shop;</p>
<p>He'll fill your pit and boxes to the brim,</p>
<p>Where, rain'd in crowds, you see yourselves in him.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm" id="page_357"></span>
Sure there's some spell, our poet never knew,</p>
<p>In <i>Hullibabilah de</i>, and <i>Chu, chu, chu</i>;</p>
<p>But <i>Marababah sahem</i><a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_3-2">[2]</a> most did touch you;</p>
<p>That is, Oh how we love the Mamamouchi!</p>
<p>Grimace and habit sent you pleased away:</p>
<p>You damned the poet, and cried up the play.</p>
<p class="i1">This thought had made our author more uneasy,</p>
<p>But that he hopes I'm fool enough to please ye.</p>
<p>But here's my grief,&mdash;though nature, joined with art,</p>
<p>Have cut me out to act a fooling part,</p>
<p>Yet, to your praise, the few wits here will say,</p>
<p>'Twas imitating you taught Haynes to play.</p>

<h4 class="scn">ACT I.<br />
SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Room, a great glass placed.</i></h4>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Benito,</span> with a guitar in his hand.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> [<span class="sdm">Bowing to the glass.</span>] Save you, sweet signior
Benito; by my faith I am glad to see you look
so bonnily to-day. Gad, sir, every thing becomes
you to a miracle: your peruke, your clothes, your
hat, your shoe-ties; and, gad, sir, let me tell you,
you become every thing; you walk with such a
grace, and you bow so pliantly!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aurelian.</span> [<span class="sdm">Within.</span>] Benito, where are you, sirrah?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> Sirrah! That my damned master should
call a man of my extraordinary endowments, sirrah!
A man of my endowments? Gad, I ask my
own pardon, I mean a person of my endowments;
for a man of my parts and talents, though he be but
a <i>valet de chambre</i>, is a person; and let me tell my
master&mdash;Gad, I frown too, as like a person as any
jack-gentleman of them all; but, gad, when I do
<span class="pgnm" id="page_360"></span>
not frown, I am an absolute beauty, whatever this
glass says to the contrary; and, if this glass deny
it, 'tis a base lying glass; so I'll tell it to its face,
and kick it down into the bargain.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> [<span class="sdm">Within.</span>] Why, Benito, how long shall we
stay for you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> I come, sir.&mdash;What the devil would he
have? But, by his favour, I'll first survey my dancing
and my singing. [<span class="sdm">He plays on his guitar,
and dances and sings to the glass.</span>] I think that
was not amiss: I think so. Gad, I can dance
[<span class="sdm">Lays down the guitar.</span>] and play no longer, I am in
such a rapture with myself. What a villanous fate
have I! With all these excellencies, and a profound
wit, and yet to be a serving-man!</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Aurelian</span> and <span class="cnm">Camillo.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Why, you slave, you dog, you son of twenty
fathers, am I to be served at this rate eternally?
A pox of your conceited coxcomb!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Nay, pr'ythee, Aurelian, be not angry.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> You do not know this rogue, as I do, Camillo.
Now, by this guitar, and that great looking-glass,
I am certain how he has spent his time. He
courts himself every morning in that glass at least
an hour; there admires his own person, and his parts,
and studies postures and grimaces, to make himself
yet more ridiculous than he was born to be.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> You wrong him, sure.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> I do; for he is yet more fool than I can
speak him. I never sent him on a message, but he
runs first to that glass, to practise how he may become
his errand. Speak, is this a lie, sirrah?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> I confess, I have some kindness for the
mirror.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> The mirror! there's a touch of his poetry
too; he could not call it a glass. Then the rogue
<span class="pgnm" id="page_361"></span>
has the impudence to make sonnets, as he calls
them; and, which is greater impudence, he sings
them too; there's not a street in all Rome which
he does not nightly disquiet with his villanous serenade:
with that guitar there, the younger brother
of a cittern, he frights away the watch; and for his
violin, it squeaks so lewdly, that Sir Tibert<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_4-1">[1]</a> in the
gutter mistakes him for his mistress. 'Tis a mere
cat-call.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Is this true, Benito?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> to <i>Cam.</i> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] My master, sir, may say
his pleasure; I divert myself sometimes with hearing
him. Alas, good gentleman, 'tis not given to all
persons to penetrate into men's parts and qualities;
but I look on you, sir, as a man of judgment, and
therefore you shall hear me play and sing.<br />
<span class="sdr">[He takes up the guitar, and begins.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Why, you invincible sot you, will nothing
mend you? Lay it down, or&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> to <i>Cam.</i> Do ye see, sir, this enemy to the
muses? he will not let me hold forth to you. [<span class="sdm">Lays
down the guitar.</span>] O envy and ignorance, whither
will you!&mdash;But, gad, before I'll suffer my parts to
be kept in obscurity&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur</span>, What will you do, rascal?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> I'll take up the guitar, and suffer heroically.
<span class="sdr">[He plays, <span class="cnm">Aur.</span> kicks.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> What? do you mutiny?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> Ay, do, kick till your toes ache; I'll be baffled
in my music by ne'er a foot in Christendom.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> I'll put you out of your tune, with a vengeance to you.<br />
<span class="pgnm" id="page_362"></span>
<span class="sdr">[As <span class="cnm">Aurelian</span> kicks harder, <span class="cnm">Benito</span> sings faster,
and sometimes cries out.</span><br /><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> holding <i>Aur.</i> Nay, then, 'tis time to stickle<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_4-2">[2]</a>.
Hold, Aurelian, pr'ythee spare Benito, you know we
have occasion for him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> I think that was well kicked.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> And I think that was well sung too.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Enough, Aurelian.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> No, sir; let him proceed to discourage virtue
and see what will come on it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Now to our business. But we must first
instruct Benito.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Be ruled by me, and do not trust him. I
prophesy he'll spoil the whole affair; he has a worm
in his head as long as a conger, a brain so barren of
all sense, and yet so fruitful of foolish plots, that if
he does not all things his own way, yet at least
he'll ever be mingling his designs with yours, and
go halves with you; so that, what with his ignorance,
what with his plotting, he'll be sure to ruin
you with an intention to serve you. For my part,
I had turned him off long since, but that my wise
father commanded the contrary.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Still you speak, as if what we did were
choice, and not necessity. You know their uncle
is suspicious of me, and consequently jealous of all
my servants; but if we employ yours, who is not
suspected, because you are a stranger, I doubt not
to get an assignation with the younger sister.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Well, use your own way, Camillo: but if it
ever succeed with his management&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> You must understand then, Benito, that
this old Signior Mario has two nieces, with one of
which I am desperately in love, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside to him.</span>] I understand you already, sir,
<span class="pgnm" id="page_363"></span>
and you desire love reciprocal. Leave your business
in my hands; and, if it succeed not, think me no
wiser than my master.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Pray take me with you. These sisters are
great beauties, and vast fortunes; but, by a clause
in their father's will, if they marry without their
uncle's consent, are to forfeit all. Their uncle, who
is covetous and base to the last degree, takes advantage
of this clause; and, under pretence of not
finding fit matches for them, denies his consent to
all who love them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> Denies them marriage! Very good, sir.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> More than this, he refuses access to any
suitor, and immures them in a mean apartment on
the garden side, where he barbarously debars them
from all human society.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> Uses them most barbarously! Still better
and better.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> The younger of these sisters, Violetta, I
have seen often in the garden, from the balcony in
this chamber, which looks into it; have divers times
shot tickets on the point of an arrow, which she
has taken; and, by the signs she made me, I find
they were not ill received.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> I'll tell you now, just such an amour as this
had I once with a young lady, that&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Quote yourself again, you rogue, and my
feet shall renew their acquaintance with your
buttocks.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Dear Benito, take care to convey this ticket
to Violetta; I saw her just now go by to the next
chapel: be sure to stand ready to give her holy
water, and slip the ticket into the hand of her woman
Beatrix; and take care the elder sister, Laura,
sees you not, for she knows nothing of our amour.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> A word to the wise. Have you no service
to Laura? <span class="sdr">[To <span class="cnm">Aur.</span></span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_364"></span>
<span class="cnm">Aur.</span> None that I shall trouble you withal; I'll
see first what returns you make from this voyage,
before I put in my venture with you. Away; begone,
Mr Mercury.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ben.</span> I fly, Mr Jupiter. <span class="sdr">[Exit.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> This lady, Laura, I have seen from your
balcony, and was seen by her. Methought, too,
she looked with a languishing eye upon me, as who
should say, Are you a man, and have no pity for a
poor distressed virgin? For my part, I never found
so much disposition in myself to love any woman
at first sight. Handsome she is; of that I am certain.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> And has wit, I dare assure you; but I have
not heard she has admitted of any gallantry.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Her hour is not come yet; she has not met
with a man to love; when that happens, (as I am
resolved to push my fortune) you shall see that, as
her love warms, her virtue will melt down, and dissolve
in it; for there's no such bawd to a woman,
as her own wit is.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> I look upon the assignation as certain;
will you promise me to go? You and Benito shall
walk in the garden, while I search the nymph
within the shade. One thing I had forgot to tell
you, that our general of the church, the Duke of
Mantua, and the prince his son, are just approaching
the gates of Rome. Will you go see the ceremony
of their entrance?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> With all my heart. They say he has behaved
himself gallantly against the French, at their
return from Naples. Besides, I have a particular
knowledge of young prince Frederick, ever since
he was last at our Venetian carnivals.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Away, then, quickly; lest we miss the
solemnity. <span class="sdr">[Exeunt.</span></p>

I was fourteen, and now am ready for another execution.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Lau.</span> A very forward rose-bud: You open apace,
gentlewoman. I find indeed your desires are quick
enough; but where will you have cunning to carry
on your business with decency and secrecy? Secrecy,
I say, which is a main part of chastity in our sex.
Where wit, to be sensible of the delicacies of love?
the tenderness of a farewell-sigh for an absence? the
joy of a return? the zeal of a pressing hand? the
sweetness of little quarrels, caused and cured by the
excess of love? and, in short, the pleasing disquiets
of the soul, always restless, and wandering up and
down in a paradise of thought, of its own making?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vio.</span> If I understood not thus much before, I find

No, good Violetta, I never was in love; all
my experience is from plays and romances. But,
who is this man, to whom you have promised an assignation?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vio.</span> You'll tell my uncle.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Lau.</span> I hate my uncle more than you do.</p>

and he tells me his intentions are honourable.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_367"></span>
<span class="cnm">Lau.</span> Have I not seen him lately in his balcony,
which looks into our garden, with another handsome
gentleman in his company, who seems a stranger?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vio.</span> They are the same. Do you think it a reasonable
thing, dear Laura, that my uncle should
keep us so strictly, that we must be beholden to
hearsay, to know a young gallant is in the next

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vio.</span> That I would meet him at eight this evening,

or this Benito, know your maid Beatrix?</p>

seen her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Lau.</span> 'Tis concluded then. You shall meet your
servant, but I'll be your Beatrix: I'll go instead of
her, and counterfeit your waiting-woman; in the

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Why, sir, we pass our time, either in conversation
alone, or in love alone, or in love and conversation
together.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Come, explain, explain, my counsel learned
in the laws of living.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> For conversation alone; that's either in
going to court, with a face of business, and there
discoursing of the affairs of Europe, of which Rome,
you know, is the public mart; or, at best, meeting
the virtuosi, and there wearying one another with
rehearsing our own works in prose and poetry.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Away with that dry method, I will have
none on't. To the next.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Love alone, is either plain wenching, where
every courtezan is your mistress, and every man your
rival; or else, what's worse, plain whining after one
woman: that is, walking before her door by day,
and haunting her street by night, with guitars,
dark-lanthorns, and rondaches<a class="ftnt" href="#Assig_4-3">[3]</a>.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_369"></span>
<span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Which, I take it, is, or will he our case, Camillo.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Neither of these will fit my humour: If your
third prove not more pleasant, I shall stick to the old
Almain recreation; the divine bottle, and the bounteous
glass, that tuned up old Horace to his odes.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> You shall need to have no recourse to that;
for love and conversation will do your business:
that is, sir, a most delicious courtezan,&mdash;I do not
mean down-right punk,&mdash;but punk of more than ordinary
sense in conversation; punk in ragou, punk,
who plays on the lute, and sings; and, to sum up all,
punk, who cooks and dresses up herself, with poignant
sauce, to become a new dish every time she is served
up to you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> This I believe, Aurelian, is your method of
living, you talk of it so savourily.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> There is yet another more insipid sort of love
and conversation: As, for example, look you there,
sir; the courtship of our nuns. [<span class="sdm">Pointing to the Nunnery.</span>]
They talk prettily; but, a pox on them, they
raise our appetites, and then starve us. They are
as dangerous as cold fruits without wine, and are
never to be used but where there are abundance of
wenches in readiness, to qualify them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> But yet they are ever at hand, and easy to
come by; and if you'll believe an experienced sinner,
easiness in love is more than half the pleasure
of it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> This way of chatting pleases me; for debauchery,
I hate it; and to love is not in my nature,
except it be my friends. Pray, what do you
call that nunnery?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> 'Tis a house of Benedictines, called the <i>Torre

my enemy; for since it is impossible to see, and not
admire you, the name of Lucretia is the best excuse
for my defeat.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Persons, like prince Frederick, ought not to
assault religious houses, or to pursue chastity and
virtue to their last retreat.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> A monastery is no retreat for chastity; 'tis
only a hiding place for bad faces, where they are
thrust in crowds together, like heaps of rubbish out
of the way, that the world may not be peopled
with deformed persons: And that such, who are out
of play themselves, may pray for a blessing on their
endeavours, who are getting handsome children, and
carrying on the work for public benefit.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Then you would put off heaven with your
leavings, and use it like them, who play at cards
alone; take the courts for yourselves, and give the
refuse to the gentlemen.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> You mistake me, madam; I would so contrive
it, that heaven and we might be served at
once. We have occasion for wit and beauty; now
piety and ugliness will do as well for heaven: that
plays at one game, and we at another; and therefore
<span class="pgnm" id="page_373"></span>
heaven may make its hand with the same cards
that we put out.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> I could easily convince you, if the argument
concerned me; hut I am one of those, whom,
for want of wit and beauty, you have condemned
to religion; and therefore am your humble servant,
to pray for your handsome wife and children.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Heaven forbid, madam, that I should condemn
you, or indeed any handsome woman, to be
religious! No, madam; the occasions of the world
are great and urgent for such as you; and, for my
part, I am of opinion, that it is as great a sin for a
beauty to enter into a nunnery, as for an ugly woman
to stay out of it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> The cares of the world are not yet upon
you; but as soon as ever you come to be afflicted
with sickness, or visited with a wife, you'll be content
I should pray for you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Any where rather than in a cloyster; for,
truly, I suppose, all your prayers there will be how
to get out of it; and, upon that supposition, madam,
I am come to offer you my service for your
redemption. Come, faith, be persuaded, the church
shall lose nothing by it: I'll take you out, and put
in two or three crooked apostles in your place.<br />

SCENE I.&mdash;<i>The Front of the Nunnery.</i></h4>

<p class="sdn"><span class="cnm">Ascanio,</span> and <span class="cnm">Hippolita,</span> at the Grate.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Hip.</span> I see you have kept touch, brother.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> As a man of honour ought, sister, when he
is challenged. And now, according to the laws of
duel, the next thing is to strip, and, instead of seconds,
to search one another.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_383"></span>
<span class="cnm">Hip.</span> We will strip our hands, if you please, brother;
for they are the only weapons we must use.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> That were to invite me to my loss, sister;
I could have made a full meal in the world, and you
would have me take up with hungry commons in
the cloyster. Pray mend my fare, or I am gone.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Hip.</span> O, brother, a hand in a cloyster is fare like
flesh in Spain; 'tis delicate, because 'tis scarce. You
may be satisfied with a hand, as well as I am pleased
with the courtship of a boy.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> You may begin with me, sister, as Milo
did; by carrying a calf first, you may learn to carry
an ox hereafter. In the mean time produce your
hand, I understand nun's flesh better than you imagine:
Give it me, you shall see how I will worry it.
[<span class="sdm">She gives her hand.</span>] Now could not we thrust out
our lips, and contrive a kiss too?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Hip.</span> Yes, we may; but I have had the experience

<p class="sdn">The Prince and <span class="cnm">Lucretia</span> appear.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Sir, though your song was pleasant, yet
there was one thing amiss in it,&mdash;that was, your rallying
of religion.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Do you speak well of my friend Love, and
I'll try to speak well of your friend Devotion.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> I can never speak well of love: 'Twas to
avoid it that I entered here.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Then, madam, you have met your man;
for, to confess the truth to you, I have but counterfeited
love, to try you; for I never yet could
love any woman: and, since I have seen you, and
do not, I am certain now I shall 'scape for ever.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_384"></span>
<span class="cnm">Luc.</span> You are the best man in the world, if you
continue this resolution. Pray, then, let us vow
solemnly these two things: the first, to esteem each
other better than we do all the world besides; the
next, never to change our amity to love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Agreed, madam. Shall I kiss your hand
on it?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> That is too like a lover; or if it were not,
the narrowness of the grate will excuse the ceremony.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Hip.</span> No, but it will not, to my knowledge: I
have tried every bar many a fair time over; and at
last have found out one, where a hand may get
through, and be gallanted.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> [<span class="sdm">giving her hand.</span>] There, sir, 'tis a true one.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> [<span class="sdm">kissing it.</span>] This, then, is a seal to our perpetual
friendship, and defiance to all love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> That seducer of virtue.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> That disturber of quiet.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> That madness of youth.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> That dotage of old age.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> That enemy to good humour.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> And, to conclude all, that reason of all unreasonable
actions.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> This doctrine is abominable; do not believe
it, sister.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Hip.</span> No; if I do, brother, may I never have comfort
from sweet youth at my extremity.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> But remember one article of our friendship,
that though we banish love, we do not mirth, nor
gallantly; for I declare, I am for all extravagancies,
but just loving.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Just my own humour; for I hate gravity
and melancholy next to love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> Now it comes into my head, the duke of
Mantua makes an entertainment to night in masquerade:
If you love extravagancy so well, madam,
<span class="pgnm" id="page_385"></span>
I'll put you into the head of one; lay by your nunship
for an hour or two, and come amongst us in
disguise.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> My boy is in the right, madam. Will you
venture? I'll furnish you with masking-habits.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Hip.</span> O my dear sister, never refuse it; I keep
the keys, you know: I'll warrant you we will return
before we are missed. I do so long to have
one fling into the sweet world again, before I die.
Hang it, at worst, it is but one sin more, and then
we will repent for all together.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> But if I catch you in the world, sister, I'll
make you have a better opinion of the flesh and
the devil for ever after.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> If it were known, I were lost for ever.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> How should it be known? You have her
on your side, there, that keeps the keys: And, put
the worst, that you are taken in the world, the
world is a good world to stay in; and there are
certain occasions of waking in a morning, that may
be more pleasant to you than your matins.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Fye, friend, these extravagancies are a breach
of articles in our friendship. But well, for once,
I'll venture to go out: Dancing and singing are
but petty transgressions.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> My lord, here is company approaching;
we shall be discovered.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Adieu, then, <i>jusqu' a revoir</i>; Ascanio shall
be with you immediately, to conduct you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> How will you disguise, sister? Will you be
a man or a woman?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Hip.</span> A woman, brother page, for life: I should
have the strangest thoughts if I once wore breeches.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> A woman, say you? Here is my hand, if
I meet you in place convenient, I'll do my best to

good humour. She, who is armed with gaiety and
wit, needs no other weapon to conquer me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> We lovers are the great creators of wit in
our mistresses. For Beatrix, she is a mere utterer
of yes and no, and has no more sense than what
will just dignify her to be an arrant waiting-woman;
that is, to lie for her lady, and take your money.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> It may be, then, I found her in the exaltation
of her wit; for certainly women have their
good and ill days of talking, as they have of looking.</p>

to drive out Laura; and so one poison has expelled
the other.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Troth, not absolutely neither; for I dote
on Laura's beauty, and on Beatrix's wit: I am
wounded with a forked arrow, which will not easily
be got out.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Not to lose time in fruitless complaints, let
us pursue our new contrivance, that you may see
your two mistresses, and I my one.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> That will not now be difficult: This plot's
so laid, that I defy the devil to make it miss. The

woman of the house, by which they are to pass to
church, is bribed; the ladies are by her acquainted

us any mischief?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Never doubt but he will succeed: Your

<span class="cnm">Duke</span> [<span class="sdm">After the dance.</span>] My curiosity redoubles;
I must needs hail that unknown vessel, and enquire
whither she's bound, and what freight she carries.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> She's not worth your trouble, sir: She'll
either prove some common courtezan in disguise,
or, at best, some homely person of honour, that
only dances well enough to invite a sight of herself,
and would look ill enough to fright you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> That's maliciously said; all I see of her is
charming, and I have reason to think her face is of
the same piece; at least I'll try my fortune.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> 'Tis the duke himself, who comes to court
you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Peace, I'll fit him; for I have been informed,
to the least tittle, of his actions since he came to
town.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> [<span class="sdm">To <span class="cnm">Luc.</span></span>] Madam, the duke of Mantua,
whom you must needs imagine to be in this company,
has sent me to you, to know what kind of
face there is belonging to that excellent shape, and
to those charming motions, which he observed so
lately in your dancing.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Tell his highness, if you please, that there
is a face within the mask, so very deformed, that,
if it were discovered, it would prove the worst visor
of the two; and that, of all men, he ought not to
desire it should be exposed, because then something
would be found amiss in an entertainment, which
he has made so splendid and magnificent.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> The duke, I am sure, would be very proud
of your compliment, but it would leave him more
unsatisfied than before; for, he will find in it so
<span class="pgnm" id="page_398"></span>
much of gallantry, as, being added to your other
graces, will move him to a strange temptation of
knowing you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> I should still have the same reason to refuse
him; for 'twere a madness, when I had charmed
him by my motion and converse, to hazard the loss
of that conquest by my eyes.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> I am on fire 'till I discover her. [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>]&mdash;At
least, madam, tell me of what family you are.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Will you be satisfied, if I tell you I am of
the Colonne? You have seen Julia of that house?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Then you are she.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Have I not her stature most exactly?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> As near as I remember.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> But, by your favour, I have nothing of her
shape; for, if I may be so vain to praise myself,
she's a little thicker in the shoulders, and, besides,
she moves ungracefully.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Then you are not she again.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> No, not she: But you have forgotten Emilia
of the Ursini, whom the duke saluted yesterday
at her balcony, when he entered. Her air and motion&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Are the very same with yours. Now I am
sure I know you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> But there's too little of her to make a beauty:
My stature is more advantageous.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> You have cozened me again.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Well, I find at last I must confess myself:
What think you of Eugenia Beata? The duke
seemed to be infinitely pleased last night, when my
brother presented me to him at the Belvidere.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Now I am certain you are she, for you
have both her stature and her motion.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> But, if you remember yourself a little better,
there's some small difference in our wit; for
<span class="pgnm" id="page_399"></span>
she has indeed the air and beauty of a Roman lady,
but all the dulness of a Dutch woman.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> I see, madam, you are resolved to conceal
yourself, and I am as fully resolved to know you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> See which of our resolutions will take place.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> I come from the duke, and can assure you,
he is of an humour to be obeyed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> And I am of an humour not to obey him.
But why should he be so curious?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> If you would have my opinion, I believe
he is in love with you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Without seeing me?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Without seeing all of you: Love is love,
let it wound us from what part it please; and if he
have enough from your shape and conversation, his
business is done, the more compendiously, without
the face.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> But the duke cannot be taken with my conversation,
for he never heard me speak.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] 'Slife, I shall discover myself.&mdash;Yes
madam, he stood by <i>incognito</i>, and heard me
speak with you: But&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> I wish he had trusted to his own courtship,
and spoke himself; for it gives us a bad impression
of a prince's wit, when we see fools in favour about
his person.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Whatever I am, I have it in commission
from him to tell you, he's in love with you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> The good old gentleman may dote, if he so
pleases; but love, and fifty years old, are stark nonsense.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> But some men, you know, are green at
fifty.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Yes, in their understandings.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> You speak with great contempt of a
prince, who has some reputation in the world.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_400"></span>
<span class="cnm">Luc.</span> No; 'tis you that speak with contempt of
him, by saying he is in love at such an age.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Then, madam, 'tis necessary you should
know him better for his reputation; and that shall
be, though he violate the laws of masquerade, and
force you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> I suspected this from his violent temper.
[<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] Sir, the emperor's ambassador is here in
masquerade, and I believe this to be his lady: It

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> To confess the truth, madam, I stole it
out of Hippolita's pocket, to take the print of it in

Is't come to this, after all my boastings and declarations
against it? Sure I loved her before, and did
not know it, till I feared to lose her: There's the
reason. I had never desired her, if my father had
not. This is just the longing of a woman: She never
finds the appetite in herself, till she sees the
meat on another's plate. I'm glad, however, you
took the impression of the key; but 'twas not well
to fright them.</p>

but just that the world should make reprisals on the
monastery.</p>

the forces have been stoutly drawn up on both

from the monastery; and have orders from your Platonic
mistress to tell you, she expects you this evening
in the garden of the nunnery; withal, she delivered
me this letter for you.</p>

very well, 'twas a loose long robe, streaked
black and white, girt with a large silver ribband,

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> So, now we are alone, what said Lucretia?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Val.</span> When first I pressed her to this assignation,<br />
She spoke like one in doubt what she should do;<br />
She demurred much upon the decency of it,<br />
And somewhat too she seemed to urge, of her<br />
Engagement to the prince: In short, sir,<br />
I perceived her wavering, and closed with the opportunity.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> O, when women are once irresolute, betwixt
the former love and the new one, they are sure to
come over to the latter. The wind, their nearest
likeness, seldom chops about to return into the old
corner.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Val.</span> In conclusion, she consented to the interview;
and for the rest, I urged it not, for I suppose
she will hear reason sooner from your mouth than
mine.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_435"></span>
<span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Her letter is of the same tenor with her
discourse, full of doubts and doubles; like a hunted
hare when she is near tired. The garden, you say,
is the place appointed?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Val.</span> It is, sir; and the next half hour the time.
But, sir, I fear the prince your son will never bear
the loss of her with patience.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> 'Tis no matter; let the young gallant storm
to-night, to-morrow he departs from Rome.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Val.</span> That, sir, will be severe.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> He has already received my commands to
travel into Germany. I know it stung him to the
quick, but he's too dangerous a rival: the soldiers
love him too; when he's absent they will respect
me more. But I defer my happiness too long; dismiss
my guards there.<br />

<h4 class="scn">SCENE III.</h4>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Frederick</span> and <span class="cnm">Ascanio.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> 'Tis true, he is my father; but when nature<br />
Is dead in him, why should it live in me?<br />
What have I done that I am banished Rome,<br />
The world's delight, and my soul's joy, Lucretia,<br />
And sent to reel with midnight beasts in Almain!<br />
I cannot, will not, bear it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asca.</span> I'm sure you need not, sir; the army is all
yours; they wish a youthful monarch, and will resent
your injuries.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Heaven forbid it! and yet I cannot lose Lucretia.<br />
There's something I would do, and yet would shun<br />
The ill, that must attend it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_436"></span>
<span class="cnm">Asca.</span> You must resolve, for the time presses. She
told me, this hour, she had sent for your father:
what she means I know not, for she seemed doubtful,
and would not tell me her intention.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> If she be false&mdash;yet, why should I suspect
her? Yet why should I not? She's a woman;
that includes ambition and inconstancy; then, she's
tempted high: 'twere unreasonable to expect she
should be faithful: Well, something I have resolved,
and will about it instantly; and if my friends prove
faithful, I shall prevent the worst.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Aurelian</span> and <span class="cnm">Camillo,</span> guarded.</p>

<p class="dlg">Aurelian and Camillo? How came you thus attended?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cam.</span> You may guess at the occasion, sir; pursuing
the adventure which brought us to meet you
in the garden, we were taken by Don Mario.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> And, as the devil would have it, when both
we and our mistresses were in expectation of a more
pleasing lodging.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Faith, that's very hard, when a man has
charged and primed, and taken aim, to be hindered
of his shoot.&mdash;Soldiers, release these gentlemen, I'll
answer it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cap.</span> Sir, we dare not disobey our orders.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> I'll stand betwixt you and danger. In the
mean time take this, as an acknowledgment of the
kindness you do me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cap.</span> Ay, marry, there's rhetoric in gold: who
can deny these arguments: Sir, you may dispose of
our prisoners as you please; we'll use your name, if
we are called in question.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Do so. Goodnight, good soldiers. [<span class="sdm">Exeunt
soldiers.</span>] Now, gentlemen, no thanks; you'll find
occasion instantly to reimburse me of my kindness.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_437"></span>
<span class="cnm">Cam.</span> Nothing but want of liberty could have
hindered us from serving you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Meet me within this half hour, at our monastery;
and if, in the mean time, you can pick up
a dozen of good fellows, who dare venture their
lives bravely, bring them with you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> I hope the cause is bad too, otherwise we
shall not deserve your thanks. May it be for demolishing
that cursed monastery!</p>

<h4 class="scn">SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>The Nunnery Garden.</i></h4>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Duke</span> and <span class="cnm">Lucretia.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> In making this appointment,<br />
I go too far, for one of my profession;<br />
But I have a divining soul within me,<br />
Which tells me, trust reposed in noble natures<br />
Obliges them the more.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> I come to be commanded, not to govern:<br />
Those few soft words, you sent me, have quite altered<br />
My rugged nature; if it still be violent,<br />
'Tis only fierce and eager to obey you;<br />
Like some impetuous flood, which, mastered once,<br />
With double force bends backward.<br />
The place of treaty shows you strongest here;<br />
For still the vanquished sues for peace abroad,<br />
While the proud victor makes his terms at home.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> That peace, I see, will not be hard to make,<br />
When either side shows confidence of noble dealing<br />
From the other.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> And this, sure, is our case, since both are met alone.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> 'Tis mine, sir, more than yours.<br />
<span class="pgnm" id="page_438"></span>
To meet you single, shows I trust your virtue;<br />
But you appear distrustful of my love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> You wrong me much; I am not.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Excuse me, sir, you keep a curb upon me;<br />
You awe me with a letter, which you hold<br />
As hostage of my love; and hostages<br />
Are ne'er required but from suspected faith.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> We are not yet in terms of perfect peace;<br />
Whene'er you please to seal the articles,<br />
Your pledge shall be restored.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> That were the way to keep us still at distance;<br />
For what we fear, we cannot truly love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> But how can I be then secure, that, when<br />
Your fear is o'er, your love will still continue?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Make trial of my gratitude; you'll find<br />
I can acknowledge kindness.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> But that were to forego the faster hold,<br />
To take a loose, and weaker.<br />
Would you not judge him mad, who held a lion<br />
In chains of steel, and changed them for a twine?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> But love is soft,<br />
Not of the lion's nature, but the dove's;<br />
An iron chain would hang too heavy on a tender neck.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Since on one side there must be confidence,<br />
Why may not I expect, as well as you,<br />
To have it plac'd in me? Repose your trust<br />
Upon my royal word.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> As 'tis the privilege of womankind,<br />
That men should court our love,<br />
And make the first advances; so it follows,<br />
That you should first oblige; for 'tis our weakness<br />
Gives us more cause of fear, and therefore you,<br />
Who are the stronger sex, should first secure it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> But, madam, as you talk of fear from me,<br />
I may as well suspect design from you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm" id="page_439"></span>
<span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Design! of giving you my love more freely;<br />
Of making you a title to my heart,<br />
Where you by force would reign.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> O that I could believe you! But your words<br />
Are not enough disorder'd for true love;<br />
They are not plain, and hearty, as are mine;<br />
But full of art, and close insinuation:<br />
You promise all, but give me not one proof<br />
Of love before; not the least earnest of it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> And what is then this midnight conversation?<br />
These silent hours divided from my sleep?<br />
Nay, more, stolen from my prayers with sacrilege,<br />
And here transferred to you? This guilty hand,<br />
Which should be used in dropping holy beads,<br />
But now bequeathed to yours? This heaving heart,<br />
Which only should be throbbing for my sins,<br />
But which now beats uneven time for you?<br />
These are my arts! and these are my designs!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> I love you more, Lucretia, than my soul;<br />
Nay, than yours too; for I would venture both,<br />
That I might now enjoy you; and if what<br />
You ask me, did not make me fear to lose you,<br />
Though it were even my life, you should not be denied it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Then I will ask no more.<br />
Keep still my letter, to upbraid me with it:<br />
To say, when I am sullied with your lust,<br />
And fit to be forsaken,&mdash;Go, Lucretia,<br />
To your first love; for this, for this, I leave you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Oh, madam, never think that day can come!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> It must, it will; I read it in your looks;<br />
You will betray me, when I'm once engaged.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> If not my faith, your beauty will secure you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> My beauty is a flower upon the stalk,<br />
Goodly to see; but, gathered for the scent,<br />
<span class="pgnm" id="page_440"></span>
And once with eagerness pressed to your nostrils,<br />
The sweets drawn out, 'tis thrown with scorn away.<br />
But I am glad I find you out so soon;<br />
I simply loved, and meant (with shame I own it)<br />
To trust my virgin honour in your hands.<br />
I asked not wealth for hire; and, but by chance,<br />
(I wonder that I thought on't) begged one trial,<br />
And, but for form, to have pretence to yield,<br />
And that you have denied me. Farewell! I could<br />
Have loved you, and yet, perhaps, I&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> O speak, speak out, and do not drown that word;<br />
It seemed as if it would have been a kind one;<br />
And yours are much too precious to be lost.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Luc.</span> Perhaps&mdash;I cannot yet leave loving you.<br />
There 'twas. But I recalled it in my mind,<br />
And made it false before I gave it air.<br />
Once more, farewell&mdash;I wo'not,&mdash;<br />
Now I can say I wo'not, wo'not love you. <span class="sdr">[Going.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> You shall; and this shall be the seal of my affection.

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Sir, I am come&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> To laugh at first, and then to blaze abroad,<br />
The weakness and the follies of your father.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Val.</span> Sir, he has men in arms attending him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> I know my doom then. You have taken
a popular occasion; I am now a ravisher of chastity,
fit to be made prisoner first, and then deposed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> You will not hear me, sir.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> No, I confess I have deserved my fate;<br />
For, what had these grey hairs to do with love?<br />
Or, if the unseemly folly would possess me,<br />
Why should I chuse to make my son my rival?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> Sir, you may add, you banished me from Rome,<br />
And, from the light of it, Lucretia's eyes.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Duke.</span> Nay, if thou aggravat'st my crimes, thou giv'st<br />
Me right to justify them: thou doubly art my slave,<br />

Both son and subject. I can do thee no wrong,<br />
Nor hast thou right to arraign or punish me:<br />
But thou inquir'st into thy father's years;<br />
Thy swift ambition could not stay my death,<br />
But must ride post to empire. Lead me now;<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> [<span class="sdm">Kneeling.</span>]<br />
This is not, sir, the posture of a rebel,<br />
But of a suppliant; if the name of son<br />

What first I purpos'd, I scarce know myself.<br />
Love, anger, and revenge, then rolled within me,<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fred.</span> My love, and my Lucretia, which I thought,<br />

<p>Or tales, yet more ridiculous to hear,</p>
<p>Vouched by their vicar of ten pounds a-year,&mdash;</p>
<p>Of Nuns, who did against temptation pray,</p>
<p>And discipline laid on the pleasant way:</p>
<p>Or that, to please the malice of the town,</p>
<p>Our poet should in some close cell have shown</p>
<p>Some sister, playing at content alone:</p>
<p>This they did hope; the other side did fear;</p>
<p>And both, you see, alike are cozened here.</p>
<p>Some thought the title of our play to blame;</p>
<p>They liked the thing, but yet abhorred the name:</p>
<p>Like modest punks, who all you ask afford,</p>
<p>But, for the world, they would not name that word.</p>
<p>Yet, if you'll credit what I heard him say,</p>
<p>Our poet meant no scandal in his play;</p>
<p>His Nuns are good, which on the stage are shown,</p>
<p>And, sure, behind our scenes you'll look for none.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
